14 dnodeohn tabulae: the Decemviral code of 451, 450 nen often
described by duodecim without tabulae. Among the fragments oi it
that remain is the passage to which Cic. refers: si nox furtum faxsit,
si im arisit, iure caesus esto...luci...st' sc telo drgscrzdit (Bruus, Fontes
lun's Romani, p. 30, ed. v.).

quoquomodo: it is rare in Cicero’s writings to find quisquis or qui·
cunique in a parenthetic clause without a verb, and where this is the
casea verb is easily supplied from some neighbouring verb, as here.
Later writers (Tacitus t'or example) employed quoquo modo, quocumque
modo sreely as substitutes ior quovis modo. The rule that any thiel
might lawsully be killed at night was probably obsolete in Cicero's
time.

15 tolo: a wide interpretation was put upon this word hythe Roman
lawyers· Any use of violence on the part oi the thiel was held to justily
his death.

detenderet: ie. srorn capture and identification. At Rome, tuest

¹ by one citizen from another was regarded as essentially a civil, not a

crimina] wrong, though certain disabilities attached to the thies on

judgment being given against him. A much heavier penalty was in·

flicted on the thief who was caught in the act (fur nranifestus) than

on one who escaped and had to be tracked ; it was important therefore
to seize and identity the thies on the spot.

16 poeniendum: “a matter for punishment”; some general subject
in agreement with poen. is omitted.

18 ab insta legibuer as the laws are personified here, the ab is necessary.
So Cic. osten has a natura datum as well as natura datum, nature being
treated as a personia the former phrase. See other exa. in my n. ou
Academ. 1,15.

atqut et...certee the same form in 19, l. 143 cf. 32‚ll. 9 sq. Atqui
has two uses; it introduces (r) a new step in an argument which is being
unfolded step by step as here and 32, l. 9, or (2) a mort, or a statement
in contrast with what immediately precedes (so in 19,l.14). Qui in
atqui is an old ablative (used as adverb) of quis the indefinite pronoun,
as qui (hom) is an old abl. of quis the interrogative pronoun. The
indefinite qui meant originally (like the enclitic πως) “somehow or other,''
but in compounds ceased to have any precise force. It is attached to
many words in early Latin, but in later Latin we only find atqui, alt'oqut',
amm utqui [Lucretiusl. The forms atquin etc. are erroneous.
