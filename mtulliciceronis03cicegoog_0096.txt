30 lucet senatumne scholars have rightly drawn attention to the
artificial structure of this sentence. In the first half there are three
parallel verbs, luget, maeret, and confecta est; of these the two first follow

, their subjecte while the last precedes its subject. Exactly the same is

the case with the three verbs in the second half of the sentence, squalent,

adfir'ctantur and dese'derant. 'l'here is again another triple arrangement
in tam beneficum, tam salutarem, tam mansuetum. instances of similar
elaborate coordination of phrases and clauses are by no means uncommon
in many authors. The six verbs in the sentence all convey the idea of
grief in one form or another3 this usage iscalled by the grammaticus
