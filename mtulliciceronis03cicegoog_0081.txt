7⁶ Pro MILONE ORATIO. [y 6-

i.e. “to aequit my client as a personal favour to me ’⁵ (nobis here: mihi).
So Vatinius ap. Ad Fam. 5, ro a, asuppliciunr...tibi eomlono: “I make
you a present oi the man’s punishment,” ie. “1 let the man off his
punishment on account of your intercession.”

13 mua vestra lueriis not much different from saluti vobissum’t, but
alittle stronger. Any predicative dative may be replaced by the nomina·
tive in this way3 see Roby‚ Gram. 11. p. xxix.

eam...aoalgnot1r: “that you should give the credit sor it to Milo’s
valour rather than to the good fortune of the Roman nation.” That isto
say: “I will not ask you to believe that the death os Clodius was a boon
purposely conferred by Milo on the Romans; it was rather an instance
os the good fortune which attends on the nation.”

¹4 ains “if however¹’; the word is usually, but not always, preceded
by si. “Ii” here is equivalent to “when'’ as is shown by tum in the
next line. This is common in Latin; avery frequent form of expression
is dham si prius dixero,- cf. my n. on Academ. a, 64. (For reading see
crit. n. in App. C.)

redamat: ao, l. ²5 rei publicae fortuna ,· 83, l. 23·

15 mnam bao luce: “clearer than daylight‚’¹ where we should say
“as clear as daylight.'’ In speaking oi the sun or the daylight, a
demonstrative pronoun (as lachete) is often attached to the noun; so
In Catil. 4, 16 lux haec ipsa, and sol rlle “yon sun‚” “the suu yonder''

tum namquo: denique has merely the effect of emphasising tum, aud
may best be represented in English by a repetition: “then, then.”

obsecrabo obtestaborque: these two verbs are osten joined, asin
Pro Sest. 1473 so orare and obtestari below, 92, 1. 9 and 105, 1. 29
(cf. 85, l. 19) ; but orare atque obsecrare is far commoner (Cic. Caes·
Sall. Nep. Lm). cf. n. on a, l. 15 recreat et reficit.

16 cetera: “all else”; i.e. the constitutional privileges which Clodius
had destroyed by his violence.

ry vibam ub uorat detenderet explanatory os hoc. But hoc ignoretis
followedby a clause with accus. and infin, below, 8, l. n. The sub·
junctive with ut is about as common as the accus. with infin. in such
explanatory clauses.

audam: almost always used in a bad sense (“recklessness”) in the
best periodos Latin, excepting in accounts ol battles‚ in which even
recklessness may be a virtue.

18 ut: kept back till late in the clause, in order to bring into pro·
millenae the words vitam...telisqur.
