Edited sor Schools and Colleges. N ew Euhion, with additions and
corrections. Extra scap. 8vo. gs. 6d.

“Mr Reid has decidedly attained his aim, namely. ‘a thorough examination ot' tlie
Liunity ot' the dialogue.’ . . . The revision os the text is most valuable, and comprehende
sundry acute corrections. . . . This volume, like Mr Reid’s other editions, is a solid gain
to the scholarship os the country.''—Atlienaeum.

“A more distinct gain to scholarship is Mr Reid's able and thorouglr edition of the
De Amitim of Cicero, a work os which, whether we regard tlie exhaustive introduction
or the instructive and most suggestive commentarii, it would be difficult to speak too
highly. . .. When we come to the commentary‚ we are only amazed by its fulness in
proportioni to its bulk. Nothing is overlooked which can tend to enlarge the learuer's
general knowledge of Ciceronian Latin or to elucidare the exffldatmday Rem'ew.

“ Mr Reid seems to have peculiar merits as a commentator.''-Guardian.

“It Is aii-admirable specimen ol caresul editing: An introduction tells us everything
we could wrsh to know about Archias, about Cicero's connexion ¹with him, about the
merits ol the trial, and the genuineness os the speech. The textis well apd carefully
