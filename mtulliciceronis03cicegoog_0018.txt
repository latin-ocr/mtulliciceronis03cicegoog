INTRODUCTION. 13

C. Causinius Schola, a Roman knight, and two men oi lower
rank, P. Pomponius and C. Clodius. The two companies of
travellers met close to Bovillae, on the further side from Rome,
near by a shrine of that very Bona Dea whose mysteries Clodius
had outragedl. lt is of considerable importance sor a judgment
about the trial to determine the hour of meeting. Asconius, a
caresul writer, who made patient inquiry into the facts, and
wrote less than a century after the events, fixes the time at about
two o’clock in the alternoon. lt suits Cicero in his speech to
insinuate that the hour was considerably later².

7. The two parties were passing peaceably and were almost
clear of each other when a quarrel began between some of Milo's
slaves, and some of those on the other sidet. Clodius turned
round with a threatening gesture; Birria at once wounded him
in the shoulder with a sword, and he was carried by his friends
into a wayside inn. Milo, soreseeing that the mischance would

’ be turned to account against him in any case, promptly decided
to take what benefit he could, by making an end os his enemy.
Clodius was, by his orders, hounded out os the tavern, and
despatched with many wounds. The innkeeper and some slaves
were murdered; the rest fied and left their masters corpse lying
on the road. At last a senator came by, S. Tedius by name, and
ordered it to be carried to Rome in his own travelling-chair
(lectica). Thus ended what Cicero called “the battle os Bovillae⁴.”
