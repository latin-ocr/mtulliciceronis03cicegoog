26 uos: Cic. identifies his interests with those ol Milo; cs. 5, l. 29

nabisduabess.

vestm auctoritati: “your influence.” It is not quite certain
whether Cic. means by vestrae the influence ol the caurls, or the
influence os the classes irom which the jurymen were drawn. Probably
the former interpretation is correct. The supporters oi Clodius arc
supposed to be hostile to the law and its administration.

osuiu luimus s writers who have discussed the difference in meaning
between amalus sum and acuatur sai have osten supposed ansatus sui
to imply that the experience oi being loved existed ior a period in
time past, but has ceased to exist at the time of speaking or writing.
[See especially Madvig, Opuscula ed. 11. p. ⁵7⁶ sq.] But in the
present passage Cic. means not merely that he and Milo have been
devoted to the cause of law and order in the past, but that they are
so still. It cannot be said that semper here is added because the tense
itseli could not give the idea of continuance at the time ol writing ; an
idea which is couveyed by the tense alone in other passages, such as
Ad Fam. 1, 7, 9 ut amnem gloriam ad quam a puero inflammatus
suisti, amni cura atquc industria consequare. The distinction between
ansatas sum and amalus fai is rather this, that the latter t'orm lays
more stress than the former on the existeme in past tinae of the expe·
rience os being loved 3 while the question whether that experience exists¹
still at the time os speaking or writing, depends entirely on the context.
The maxim sometimes laid down, that amalus sui is not used as the
perfect passive os the “state’' as opposed to “the act'' (Roby, ἕ 1453),
seems inconsistent with a certain number of passages.

27 luccamus...rscrasmur: ior the form ol the passage cl. Att. a, 6,c
vide ecquae sil spes denari an ca'stophara Pompeiana taceamus.

28 fidam mensem sapientiamque: in an enumeration consisting of
more than two words, where the earlier words are not introduced by
copulative conjunctions‚ quc may be placed aster the last as here, but
the last word and the last but one cannot be connected by et, ae or alque.

²9 anta...1auortostus=we should say“wlais more plunged in distress?'’
but the neuter expression is osten preferred in Latin3 as below 54, l. 1.

So Cic. says (ola lady) iu Ad Art. η, 11: niln'l vidisaeds'us. Note
the change to magis sollicitum, magis mercham ; Cic. could not write
sollicitius or exercitam, which are later thau his time. ’
