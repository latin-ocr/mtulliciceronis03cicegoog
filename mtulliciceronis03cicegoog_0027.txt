country house had no place among the witnesses. At the
Ι conclusion of the evidence the virulent tribune, T. Munatius
Plancus, addressed a meeting of the turbulent section ol the

citizens and exhorted them to attend on the following day in
large numbers, and so prevent Milo from escaping the fate
which he deserved.

17. On April 8 (the hundred and second day after the
murder of Clodius) when the verdict was to be given, all the
shops in the city were closed by proclamation, a measure some·
times taken by the higher magistrates when violence was feared',
sometimes by the tribunes when it was desired; in the former
case that property might be safer from destruction, in the latter
that the workpeople might be free to attend at the scene of
disorder. Every approach to the forum was blocked by armed
men. The public buildings in the forum itseli were occupied in
force Pompey‚ hemmed in bya chosen band, sat in front of
the Treasury, at the temple of Saturn. The speeches of the
counsel for the prosecution were heard in deep silence. But,
when Cicero rose, he was assailed by such clamour that, as an
ancient authority gently puts it, “he did not speak with his
wonted courage¹.” ln truth he was seized by panic and spoke
ineffectively. The speech which he delivered was taken down
by shorthand writers, 3ηά copies of it were in circulation as late
as the time of Quintilian. The oration which has come down
to us was written some time after the trial ended and doubtless
differs widely from that which was actually spoken. When Milo
was in exile he gave utteranceto a famous saying, that if Cicero
had been able to address to the jury the speech which he com·
posed in his study afterwards, he (Milo) would never have enjoyed
the fine mullets which figured on the dinner·tables of Massilia².

18. Milo was pronounced guilty by 38 votes against 13.
The votes were distributed as follows. For condemnation:
senators 12, equites 13, tribuni aerarii 13; for acquittal: senators
5, equites 4, tribuni aerarii 4³. The facts testify to a strong
