from Festus p. 264 robur quoque in carcere dt'citur is locus quo proe-
cipitatur maleficorum geum, quod ante arcis robustis includebatur.

cogent than. the argumentum there is a similar difference between

and ol both, below, p. 49, 1. 3. Exanimatum as in 65, l. 173 93, l. ²3·
aa immortalis: it is well known that Cic. generally attaches this epithet
to the plural di. The passages where it is omitted mostly contain di

penates, dr' patrii, di orienes, or short phrases like di dent, or a oontrast ⁴

between gods and men (asin 80, t 15).

οὐκ εἶπον μὲν ταῦτα, οὐκ ἔγραψα δέ, οὐδ’ ἔγραψα μέν, οὐκ ἐπρέσβευσα δέ,
οὐδ’ ἐπρέσβευσα μέν, οὑκ ἔπεισα δὲ θηβαίους, ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς διὰ
πάντων ἄχρι τῆς τελευτῆς διεξῆλθον.

poets, Livy, and late13hut Caes has only omnes puberes.
