19 mteqnam...vemo= aiter autequam Cic. osten has the indic. pres..

rarely the future-persecu never the future (which is Plautine and
Terentian but not classical); and probably never the imperf. and plup.
[De Nat. Ι)., ι, 57, quoted hy Merguet in his Lerikon sor the future,
really gives an ex. of the pres. subj. (aggrediar)].

ontionem: here “part ol my speech.”

ao propria: the topics treated from 5 7 to 5 aa inclusive are not
essential to the case3 they are extra causam (92, 1. 8); cf. 23, l. a6 ad
causam, and App. B.

emtionis: the regular word for a court ol inquiry into a criminal
matter; ci. lntrod. p. 19.

ar saepe: to be taken with the words in cantione as well as iu senalu3
contione being generic in sense, as iu 26, L 3² signficavit hac saepe in
senatu, diucitin emtione. 1r is not likely that Cic. is referring only to
the hesterna centio mentioned in 3, 1. ¹4·

23 rem etc: “the point at issue''; cs. 31, l. aa, and App. B.

24 fae eit eum might have been substituted with little difference to the
sense. of course where no persen is mentioned, the construction with
accus. and inl. is necessary, as in 86, l. 8. Compare Verg. Aen. a, 40²
heu nihil inuitisfar quemquam fidere divis with 7, 692 quem nequesas
r'gm cuiquam uec sternere ferro.

25 hoe umuranr: “put this forward‚” as in 44, l. 18. So defendere
“to put lorward by way ol deseuce‚'' in 8, 1. 3 and olten.

26 primum iudicium: according to the legend narrated in Liv. 1‚26,
every sentence pronounced hya competent magistrate was executed
without appeal, until the time ol Horatius, in whose case, alter he had
been condemned sor killing his sister, an appeal was lor the first time
allowed to the whole ol the citizens in comitia assembled.

27 x. Horatt: Livy calls him Publius.

libera...llberatuar there seems to be an intentional contrast: though
the burgesses were not “frea'' yet they “freed” Horatius. Liberatus
as in 8, 1. 13. and osten, oi acquittal on trial.

28 comitile: an ablative which really expresses a point ol time “when
the conritia took place‚'’ and is therefore parallel with Idibus, brente,
and the like. solades, as in De Senectute 63.

§a aaa

1 eun...quaeratur: ie. in apublic court (quaestio); the subj. because
subordinate to solere etc.
