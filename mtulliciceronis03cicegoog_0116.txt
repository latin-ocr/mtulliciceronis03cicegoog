sss. Rea

3 oecmrtt: “the following objection meets ns”; so De Fin. r, 108
quid occurrat, non vallatas

5 at quidem etot osten an elliptic conditional sentence (apodosis
being omitted) with ri qualem, as here, ansvers an objection; so De
Fin. 3,13.

extamus...rmrrea: the so-called “periphrastic’' tenses made up os

tenses oi esse witha future partic. are common throughout Latin; but
the occurrence in such a combination oi a subjunctive tense oi esse
other than the present (as in 33,l. aa, and 51, p. 45, l. alis rare, and
especially rare in conditional sentences. The reason for thisis that, as
the participle contains within itself the notion os an unfulfilled event, it
is sufficient to put the verb in the indicative. So 47, l. 26 sr'...obvr'ur
futurus non erat, and 28, Ι. 16 si...venturus erat,· also roo, l. ιι. The
union of the fut. part. with the plup. subj. oi erreis oi great rarity; an
instance will be found in De Div. a, 21 (in all mss). In these com·
pound tenses the fut. part. often has a notion oi purpose; thus in 6,
l. ro deprecaturi sumus “we mecm to beg ior pardon” differs from
deprecabimur. In later Latin the partic. has this sense even when it
stands alone, but not in Cic. or Caes.

6 video: this is not a reference to the affidavits (testimonia, 46, l. 16);
butan inference oi Cicero’s own.

9 una...atmn1= not different in meaning3 the two words are often
combined.

obsignavi: i.e. “1 set my seal to it as a witness.” Ar a later time,

no witness to a vill could be heres under it; such too isthe rule in our
lav. In the time of Cic. the oral will (known as “nuncupative”), so
common later, was probably not in use; the testator had the choice ol
making the terms of his will known to the witnesses or ol keeping them
secret.

ra ananiam Tusc. r, 19 agere animam rt efflare.

¹3 nuntiabatur: the irnpers. use of this verb ismuch less common than ’

the personal use3 cf. 66, l. 23 and 47, l. 2511.

16 promto opus: the only ex. in the speeches os Cic. of this constr.
Quaestio epm est appears twice in the Paradene, and in Ad Att. ro, 4, rr
we hare σφω sirit Hirtio convento ‚· to parallel the attachment of the
personal name to the participle in that passage ve have to look to
Plautus.
