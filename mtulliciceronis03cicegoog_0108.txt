ἓ 36·] NOTES. 103

30 tto...motnetotlnt a possibly unique example ol a rte-clause in place
of the ordinary accusative efter achheim. There is an isolated ex. ol an
att-clause in Verr. a, r, 51.

31 consulatus: the connexion indicated by the gen. is here, as osten,
very loose.

scr. Res.

4 ὕεται enim, as often.

5 poenitor: this is the only pass. in Cic where tlte word occurs; he
desired to find another word with the same meaning as ultor (cf. n. on
1, t 6). So De Orat. r, rao iracundrlr...cupiditor poeniendi dalmi.

7 auid onmes: quid is a kind of cognate acc. :quod odium. ’

8 nutum: here aud in 1. ιο au imperfect suhj· would have been used,
had one existed in connexion with the verb.

acetum: '‘harvest-field”; probably au unparalleled metaphorioal
use, but seges is “harvest-field ” in the litera] sense in Orat. 48 3 Martial.
5, 4², 4 non reddet stm'lr's semim iacta seges.

9 omnes: nom. not accus.; cabale=omnibus duabus commune.

ιο 1110...odlnet: “it was natural that he should hate '²3 so Pro Cael.
14 magri est ut pose moleste serat quam... “it is more natural that he
should himself leel annoyance than..,.’' Sometimes ert ut merely means
“it comes about that '’ (cf. sore ut), as in Hor. od. 3, ι, 9tst ut viro νίν
latius ordriaet arbusta sulcis. The constr. is rare altogether, und is
sometimes merely periphrastic. Thus erit ut possit in Lucret. 3, 715 is
ns pleonastic as fit uti fiat in 6, 727, nor does est igitur ut mrandum
rit in Cic. De Div. ι, 128 differ from mirandum est.

ta reus Htlonla: so (ol Socrates) Hor. sat. a, 4, 3Anytr' rcum Cic.
Verr. act. pr. 6. Similarly in Plin. ep. r, Μ a delator speaks os the
men whose death he had compassed by prosecution as mei mortui.

laconum: seen. on 39. p.4r‚ ld.

¹3 tyrannum: ct'. regnaturum in 43, l. rr.

14 ln homine iniusto: “fora wrongsul man, how rightlul even?'’ ie.
being homo iniustus, Clodius might well feel that he had a right to hate
Milo. See crit. n.

15 uum suam lustumt Cic. is fond of separating quam, tam from the
words thoy qualisy, by one word as here.

ι7 detondet: 14, l. 18 n.; the change to the plural hacc eadem coar·
guam is curious.
