78 PRO MILONE ORATIO. [ἓ 8.

2 recto ot lure: so the adverb and noun are linked in Tusc. 1, 83
acre ct iure, aud commonly in the phrase recte atque ordine. Here recte
points to the moral aspect of the matter, iurato its legal aspect.

3 nisi vero: this combination invariably introduces a statement which
the writer wishes to stamp as absurd. So (very often but not always)
nisisartc. For nisi acro see 14, l. 133 19, l. τος 81,1.27; 91, l. 333
aud for nisi fartc17,L 28; 84, l. 5.

Africanum eto: Cic. tells the story in almost the same words in
De Orat. a, 106; but Livy, Epit. 59 represents the statement of
Africanus as having been made in the course of a speech in oppositiou
to a bill (rogatae) proposed by Carbo. It would seem that in an account
of the matter by some older writer the word roganti occurred in ⁴con·
nexion with Carbo's name, and that Livy understood it of proposing a ·
bill, while Cicero took it to mean putting a question. Velleius a, 4,4
and Valerius Max. 6, a, 3 follow Cicero‘s account, Valerius with some
dramatio details. Vell. makes Scipio add a “saving clause”c si is
(Gracchus) occupandae reipublicae consilium habuisset.

4 carbone: in 131, when C. supported the democratic party. But as

in the following year he was prosecuted for his share in the Gracchan
troubles and died by his own hand.

tribuno: “whcn tribune,'' not “the tribune.'’

seditioso: see crit. n. in App. C ; also on responderit.

7 anna: the slayer of Sp. Maelius, who, like Ti. Gracchus, was
accused oi plotting to make himself king (Liv. 4, 13 sq). The order
of the names Ahala Servilius is not uncommcn iu Cic. ; indeed when
the nonnn and cognomen are used together without the praenomen, as
here, the cognomen is by Cic. regularly placed before the nomen.

Ρ. Nasica: bis full name was Ρ. Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio
(the last a nickname bestowed on his father, which stuck to the family).
Although without office at the time (privatus) and without legal autho·
rity of any kind, he led the aristocratic mob which killed Ti. Gracchus
and many of his supporters. .

opimius: being consul in 123, be was armed with the senatus
consultum ultimum (see Introd. pp. 15, 16) and made an end of Gaius

Gracchus.
8 umus: he is here mentioned because he crushed Saturninus in
