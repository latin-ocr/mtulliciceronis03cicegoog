Vibienus senator. While Asc. refers the death to the time of the hurning
os Clodius, Cic. attributes it toan earlier date. Neither Dio C. 38, 16,
nor Cic. himself, in narrating elsewhere (as in the speech for Sestius)
the events to which he here allodes, makes any mention oi the death of
Vibienus or any other senator.

him as the true successor of Catiline.

not infrequent3 ct'. 44, ha1.

much oltener than that in ·e, that we may suspect the former to be alone
genuine.
