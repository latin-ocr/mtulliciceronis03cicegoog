51. P. as.

r ern vereor etc: sor the characteristics of the exordium to the
speech, see Appendix Β. Note that, like lamen and quamquam,
etsi in Cic. goes with the indicative, and if the sentence contains a
subjunctive there must be some other reason sor it, such as oratio obli-
qua, real or virtual. We have in this speech ten examples of etsi, all
with indic. On the other hand there are six instances of ctiam si, five
with subj. and one (14, l. 15) with ind.

turne stt...tn01ptentem dr this is put as a general principle (“it is
disgracet'ul for any one'') which is applied to Cicero's case by the words
nn'nimequcdeceat...me. '

a ¹1¹. nnius: Cic. so names his client in five other passages of the
speech (6, l. 83 77, ll 31 and 63 83, l. 19 ; roo, 1. 4) and sometimes else·
where3 hut in more than a hundred places he calls him Milo, usinga
less formal style. On the other hand the name Clodius is as a rule only
employed by itself when the name Milo occurs near to it, so that the
one form is assimilated to the other.

5 novt iudici nova forma: sor the emphatic repetition of the adjective
cf. Verr. a, 5, 178 lege nova novi iudices ; Pro Sest. 89 nova novi gmeris
cdr'cta ,· De F in. 3, 3imponendaque nova rebus novis noneina5 N. D. 1,·
44 3 Tusc. 1, ¹09 virtutis perfectae perfecto functus est munere.

ludici: sor this form ol the genit. see Appendix C. ι

6 quocumque mutuemur...r0qutrnnt: so Pro Scaur. 46 suppeditat...
quod dicam quocumque...oculi inciderunt. The linking of the perfect
tense with the present is unlike our idiom, which would require two
presents. It is quite certain that quicumque, quocumque (to which we
may add quelques), were not used by cic. with subj. Ii a subj. follows,
the reason sor it does not lie in the words themselves. Therelote the

reading inciderint in the passage quoted itom Pro stammam menno„—
