²3 divina n: “the motion was split up.¹’ Senators olten cried out to
the president “uiuida'’ i.e. “split up the motion into two parts and put
ench separately.’' See Ascon. 44. Cic. calls the demand flagitium
because the great majority oi the senate were against it. The disgrace.
it' any, rnther belonged to the consul who granted the nequest.

24 ntntl ιιοοοιιο ost: here only in the speeches of Cic. ior non necessust
and rare everywhere ς ci. nihil opus cst and quid mcesse esti

25 renum eto: “the rest ol the senate's resolution was made invalid by
amercenary veto,’' ie a tribune exercised his right oi rendering it use·

less. Auctoritas is the regular expression sor a vote oi the senate which
has been vetoed.

26 nt enlm eto: “but Ι am told that Cn. Pompeius by his bill gave a
pronouucemeut about the lncts and about the legal issue as well.'' Ir'c
and caum are contrasted like res and crimen in l. 19.

27 mut eto: the words caede...occisus esset are quoted from the measure.
For the argument see App. B ς and ior in qua n. on rr, l. 14.

P. ³1.

1 norror here like our “well.” The literal sense “further ” is found
in Cic, as De Orat. a, 39 perge porro, from which it passes to “more-
over” (19, l. 183 25, l. 17). Sometimes it is “however'‚’' with slightly
adversative force (Madvig on De F in· α, 25). and iu very late Latin it
acquires the meaning osred or ceterum.

2 nutet: “it is as clear as daylight.” So Phil. ra, 5 discussa cst illa
caligo...diluxit‚ patet, vrilemus onrnm. See crit. n.

3 tn tentamentorum: “where the laets are admitted‘' 3 cf. 32, ll. 4, 53
33, p. 38, l. 8. In often indicates a connexion, which may be very
ibose, between the words with which it goes and the rest os the sentence.
Our “amin’' is osten similar in use3 thus we may render Liv. 1, 17, 3
in variis voluntatibus regnari tamen omncs volebant, “amid differences
of opinion, all still desired that there should be a king.”

4 eruuntur n. on 31, l. 19.

enm qut: “one who”; not referring merely to Milo.
⁶ mm...qmn: so 96, l. 33 non tam...quam.
hancwtllum it will be seen that by the use of these words Cic.
subtly implies that his client is to be acquitted3 hanc indicatiug the
verdict which lies close to the case, illam that which is more remote
from it.
