8 iudicaretur: dependent on vetat, which is treated as a historic pre·
sent, rather strangely, seeing that the injunctions ol the law are as
operative at the moment ol writing as before. The tense oi quaereretur
is adapted to that of iudicaretur.

9 maneat: the verb is osten applied to a firm argument or established
principle3 cf. De Div. 1, 38 modo maneat id quod uagari nan patera· De
off. 3, 49 mancat ergo, quod turpe sit, id numquam essa utile ,⁰ Tac. Hist.
1, 18 quaefato manent “destiny’s decrees” (needlessly altered by some).

ro probaturus alm...memlner·ltts: directly put, this would have been
probabo, si memineratis (sut. peri), a common form of conditional sen·
tence.

s ra.

14 unqua: “in the course ot which.‘’ It is implied that others also
were killed. Qua without in would have been merely “ whereby’'; and
would have been restricted to the killing of Clodius. Cs. 15, l. 28.

senatum eto: see Introd. ἓ 12. For the form of the resolution cs.
Caes. Bell. Civ. r, a, γει· nonfaciot, eum adversras rem publicam sactu·
rum videri.

15 vero: strongly adversative, and almost equivalent to immo uero (34,
l. 14). The word is osten used with a sense as strongly affirmative.

16 sententtia: “votes'’; studiis: “sympathies.”

comprobavit: here, as usual, ol approval given after a thing has

17 hapyffimmmbmum: Cic. sometimes links these exclamatory

clauses together by conjunctions‚ sometimes places them side by side as

latest.'’

αι ambusti: “singed‘’; ot course with reference to the buming of the
body ol Clodius (Introd. 5 8). But there may be a seoond allusion. The
word was applied to men who had barely escaped condemnation in a
criminal court. Examples ol ambustus and like words employed in a
similar manner occur in Ad Att. 5, 20, 83 Liv. aa, 353 aa, 403 39. ⁶·
It is known that Cic. had acted as counsel for Plancus, the tribune in

question (Ad Fam. 7, a, 3).
