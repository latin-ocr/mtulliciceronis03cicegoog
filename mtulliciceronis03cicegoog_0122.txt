ssa] nores ιη

15 numu: Orat. 63 de rebus placatis ac minime turbulentis.

16 omnibus: “all possible ”3 cf. 3, 1. 13 sirenibus exitiis. This emphatic
use of omnis is often found.

18 tam: n. on 30, l. 8.

19 propter etc: “to whom he owes his life” 3 cf. 81, p. 57, i. 6 ; 93,l. 29.

non muti ess quam: brief for n. t. c. quanti illud quod. The cor-
respondence of tantus with quam is rather rare in Latin before Livy;
the only other ex. in Cicero’s speeches is in Verr. a, 1, 43 in the philo·
sophical works there is but one ex„ viz. De F in. 1, 11. The usage is
Plautine and Lucretiam

ar witarit: cf. explesset etc. in 63, i. 15.

aa niet...mtsteset...fuerunt= the indic. often thus occurs with the
geruudive in the apodosis‚ where subj. is in protasis, because the
gerundivc in itself implies a condition still to be fulfiiled. Cf. n. on 31,
Ι. 19.

²4 quod minua moleste ferat: something like quo magis gaudeat might
have been expected, but Cic. wishes to convey that there is no gaudium
in Milo’s case; nothing but degrees in sorrow. Trans. “which does
more to lessen his grief.”

25 madar: “is going to happen”; the present subj. often thus replaces
the cumbrous fut. subj.; cf. 4, 1. ay. The euphemism as in the common
phrase ets τι συμβῇ.

marsum maemtum persolutum: note the three words iu succession
with similar terminations.

ἕ ῦθ.

27 aad etc: the remark is oue of Cicero's own and is not put by him
in the mouth of his opponents. These quaestiones did really tell against
Milo in public opinion. It is therefore not necessary to correct sed to
at, nor yet to assume that it is used forat (in giving a supposed objection
made by an opponent), of which usage there is no sure instance iu Cic.
or his contemporaries, though it is found in Virgil, Livy and other
writers. For the facts see Introd. ἓ 15.

28 nunc: occasionally thus found with a past tense. See my n. on
Laelius De Amic. ιι (Pitt Press ed).

atrio ubertatis: the torture took piace by direction of the judge,
under the superintendence of an officer named by him, in presence of
counsei, and the evidence was recorded in writing. The atrium Liber·-
κατὰ was an official buildiug in the forum, used for manumissions in
presence of the partor urbanus, and for much other pubiicuus'mess„
