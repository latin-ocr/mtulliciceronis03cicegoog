16 INTRODUCTJON.

tlre senate had claimed the right, by this form of decree, to
invest the consuls with absolute authority, and so to override
the laws. The novelty in the present case was that there were
no consuls in existence to receive this despotic commission.
To grant the power to tribunes, an interrex and a proconsul
was, in respect of form, a startling innovation. But the ship of
state was in such a tempest that to steer her by precedent was
impossible. The senate further directed Pompey to levy troops
all over Italy. This measure seems larger than the occasion
required. But the majority in the senate seized the opportunity
to strengthen their half-hearted champion against his rival
Caesar1. Pompey quickly enrolled a guard for his own pro-
tection and proceeded to raise his troops. But not until sixty
days after the death of Clodius was an election effectedt
Pompey was appointed consul without a colleague³. This event
in itself sufficed to show that the old Republican constitution of
Rome was near its death. It was a less striking illegality that
Pompey should hold at one and the same time the authority of
Ι consul and that of a provincial governor, along with the com-
mand of an army.

and the election, Pompey had shown himself hostile to Milo,
though, before the struggle for the consulship began, the two
had been friends. Pompey refused to see Milo or even to com-
municate with him. Nay, more3 in order to alienate support
