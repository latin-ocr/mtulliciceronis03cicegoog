88 PRO MILONE ORATIO. [515—

litteram it seems to be impossible to determine exactly how the
jurors gave their votes. One view is that a single plain waxed tablet
(tabella) was given to each juror, on which he scratched either A “not
guilty'’ (Cicero’s salutaris littera, for absolvo) or C “guilty’' (tristis
littera, for condemno) or NL (non liquet) if not clear about a verdict.
There are two passages which speak plainly oi a single tablet, viz. Cic.
Div. in Caec. 24 and the Lex Acilia ἐξ 51, a (Bruns, Fontes, p. 65,
ed. v.); but the tablet which the lex describes as sorticulo was waxed
on both sides, and on one side os it was already scratched A, on the
other C; the juror had to erase one or (if uncertain) both os these
letters. No mention is made in the lex of NL. Another opinion is
that two tabellae were ordz'norily distributed to each juror, and this is ,
certainly implied by Suet. Aug. 333 a third tablet mentioned there is
denoted as exceptional. The supposition that each man received three
tablets rests mainly on Caes. Bell. Civ. 3, 83, 43 a reference to which
will show that it proves nothing. Cic. in four places intimates plainly
that the juror said “non liquet '’ and did not write NL; see Pro Clu.
76, 106, 131 and Pro Caec. ²9 (ci. Ps. Ascon. on Verr. 2, 1, 26). 1f we
could stand by an interesting passage in Gellius 14, a, 25, it would
demonstrate that a juror who could not make up his mind was com·
pelled to take an oath to that effect. Probably the manner os voting
was different at different periods and under different statutes.

lapillis Ι his danmarc reos, illis absolvere culpa Ι tum quoque sic lata est
sententia tristis.

9 oporteret: see n. on 3, l. 15.

ιο defensionem: “a possibility os deience”; the verbal nouns in ·io
osten convey the notion os possibility ; so exercitationm in 34, l. 30·
aaut: a slight zeugma, because by itself potatam darc “to assigna
penalty'' would not occur (proponere poenam being the right expression).
When poenam darc is used by itself, it means “to pay a penalty.”
11 interitum: see crit. n. (App. C).

ra tam: “to proceed‚” as osten in Cic.
quon...nnt: “the measure he took on his own initiative,” i.e. apart
from the senate, which desired a different measure.

‘a' patronas: probably indicates that Drusus dominated the senate as a
