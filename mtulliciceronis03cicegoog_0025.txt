the court which dealt with illegal organisations (de sodalicz'th)¹.
The only one of these charges which was actually heard was the
first. The prosecutors were the two Appii Claudii, nephews
os the murdered Clodius. They were, like Clodius, direct
descendants oi the famous Appius Claudius the Decemvir‚ and
were sons osone of the praetors os the year 56. The elder of
the two brothers was originally named Gaius, but changed his
name to Appius on being adopted by Appius Claudius Pulcher,
his father's brother, who was consul along with Cn. Domitius
Ahenobarbus in 54. The two prosecutors were quite young men.
Indeed to single out a criminal for prosecution was deemed
unworthy of a manos established reputat-ion, unless he had
some reason sor entertaining a personal enmity against the
culprit. But a young man might win his spurs by attacking

evidence of slaves always was, under torture. Milo answered
that these slaves were not under his control, having been set
free. Hereupon the judge, having taken the opinion of the
jurors, or sorne of thern, deeided that the prosecutors might
offer lor tortore as many as they pleased of the slaves who had
belonged to the dead Clodius, and were now the property of his
brother Appius Claudius. The evidence os some of these slaves
might be expected to be of importance. According to the pro·
visions os the statu-te, the next three days were given over to the
hearing of evidence. Apparently all the 360 jurors were present
during this stage os the case. On the sourth day (April 8) came
what was called the aequatt'o pilarum. The 360 little ballot-
balls‚ on each of which was stamped the name or initials of one
of the jurors, were examined to see that they were all of the
same size and structure, lest differences should make an unsair
drawing possible. On the following day (April 9) the names ol
