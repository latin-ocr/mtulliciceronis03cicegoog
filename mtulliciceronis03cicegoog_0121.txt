116 PRO MILONE ORATIO. [ἓ 56-

30 ab oblector this is usually interpreted to mean “by the agency of
the dovvntrodden foe‚'' Mars being supposed to use the beaten com·
batant as a scourge to smite the victor. No real parallel to this use of
ab is produced ς phrases like a quo intereat in Acad. 1, 28, where iette-
rire represents the passive of perdere (see ιι, 1. ι9 ιι), do not afford any
actual support. It is better to understand “on the side of the defeated‚'‘
“as the ally of the defeated,” comparing Pro S. Rosc. 85 clementissimus

⁴ ab innocentem Pro Cluent. 93 dicendi ab reo. The phrase dicere ab
aliqua re “to speak in favour of a proposal” is sometimes found.

31 atergo...extremts: cf. 28, 29.

33 cum incidisset: this position of cum with the verb, far away from
the beginning of tbe clause or sentence, is not very common in Cic. but
is one of the minor features of Livy's Latin. So 60, l. 16.

haesit: the metaphoris from a vessel sticking on the rocks; cf. Hor.
sat. a, 3, 205 haerentes aduerso litore naves with Tac. An. 4, 19 nec
dubie repetundarum criminibus haerebant.

§aa P. ιι.

3 manu mma: the vvord manus was applied iu early Roman law to
every kind of legal authority exercised over persons or property. Itis
seen in man-cipiunt and eman-crpore.

mutuaretur: the subject is Milo; but see crit. ιι.

, 4 tomenta: cf. App. B.

7 nthtl ad tortorem: this use of nihil od should hardly be called
colloquial (as by Richter) since it occurs in all styles of Latin. Whether
nihil ad means “nothing to do with” (as here) or “nothing compared
to” (as often), the clause in which the words occur is always elliptic, ,
without verb. See my n. on Academ. 1, 15. ’

8 eculeo: little is known of this instrument of turture. It was probably
a wooden horse on which the sufferet sat with heavy weights attached
to his limbs‚ and possibly impaled on sharp points.

11 td: seecric n.

ιι nescu: i.e. you might have made a point by saying that he only
refrained from rewarding them richly because the act would tell against
him in court.

13 qut etc: a vebum agendi omitted asin18.1. 19 and 55, 11. ιι, 15.
Cato was a Stoic, and his doctrine required the wise man to be ¹stauuch
and unwaverr'ng in face of all circumstances.
