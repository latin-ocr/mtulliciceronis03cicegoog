APPENDIX C. 159

reading, though it has little uss support 1. ιο id agamus: Momm·
sen ingeniously conjectured indagamus. 1. ιι id may be an
intrusion, developed lronr the e'oi si. 5 59, p. 48, l. 3 qui proxime
ad deos: 1 have inserted qui, which may have been driven out hythe
intrusion of Clodius as subject to accessit (so ETBS). I have also
inserted ad, for, although the word is omitted in quotation by Priscian
and Arusianus, the construction accedere aliquem (even with proxime)
{trith”thiatira¹i0l⁵dtlt⁶0ttttthll⁶¹⁸ 33.an
Pro Ligai 38 ait deas proximi accedunt and P'ro Rabir. perd. egitraxime
arideorum immortalium memen accedet. The combination of proxime
ad with accedere is found in many passages ol Cicero’s writiugs, and also
elsewhere. 5 62, l. 11 imperitorum: intimarum Hedicke, toll. by
Eberhard; Miiller approves. 5 63, 1. 13 perditor percita many
edd. (Miiller tacitly) from margin of S. The word occurs in the old
drama and in Sall. Liv. but not in Cic. Caes. Nep. Verg. Hor. and
many other writers. There is an ex. in Bell. Afr. 46 irapercitus3 cf.
Lucr. 3, 30? iraesax subdita percit. 5 64, l. ²9 quemvis r uarrevis
H, which eada Mr Clark to favour quamm's...canscientiam ound in
some early edd. Cic. may have written mediocri not modaharium.
l. 33 frenorumr many corrections have been proposed, such as erra·
mentorum, soliferrearum, sparamm (in one inferior MS). 5 7, l. a
curn tamen: “and yet all the while'’; these words have often been
needlessly changed; cf. eg. Verr. a, 5, 74. ib. Miloni: so Wolff,
Lehmann (see Miiller's crit. n.); Milo msa. An expression parallel in
meaning to timemus is certainly needed, so that metuitur Milo givesa
wrong sense. Lehm. also suggested metuit...Mila. 568, l. a ante
testaretur: so H, and ari testaretur in E is the same ; attestaretur 133
other mss antestaretur, which occurs nowhere else in non-legal literature
excepting in Hor. sat. ι, 9, 76. Antestarctur cannot, as has been sup·
posed, bear the same sense with ante t. 569, l. 4 amicitiis HE ;
amicis cett. 5 70, l. 18 vi: H onlyt vel cett. 5 74, l. 26 iniustis
uindiciis ac sacramentis: these words seem to have crept into the text
irom a marginal comment by some antiquarian, who supposed that
claims to land always involved sacramentum, which was very sar from
being the case in Cicero¹s time. The phrase iniustum sacramentum
only occurs elsewhere in Pro Dom. 78 where it should be changed to
iustum, since in libertatem there is “against ireedom.” The phrase
gppeaoeffi t.⁵tttt.t5tttt‘ttllttlhh‘tnttttttt
and if the words are to stand, intrastis must be taken in a moral
sense. Cic. only uses unumne in two other passages, Verr. a, 1, 115
and Rep. 3, 44. p. 54, l. 4 harenam: so H only; arma cett. 3
but Cic. cannot have· used the word in the sense oi “tools,'¹ nor
would he have mixed up the mention of weapons with that ol
building materials. 5 77, p. 55,l 3 manerent: even the authority
of HE cannot induce me to believe that Cic. wrote maneret here.
579, l. 31 ut ea...videmus: the reading oi H, ut ea careamus
quae uon uidemus (accepted by Mr Clark, but regarded bg adada.
