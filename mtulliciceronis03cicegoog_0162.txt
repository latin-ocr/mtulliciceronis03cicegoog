APPENDJX c. ,15⁷

p. 17, l. 4 cunctisr perhaps coniunctis should be read. ἕ 6, l. 14

sin: so HE 3 sed si STB. The latter reading is obviously derived from
the former ; sin was written si then sei, which passed (by a very com·
mon error) to set, sed; the want of si was then elt and it was inserted.
§⁸2 p. 18, l. 4: edd. have felt the awkwardness of seditiose with inter·
rogaretur. Possibly it is an error for invidiose (ἓ 11, l. 11); 01 in
contionemaybeerroneousforcontiononte. l.6resp0nderit: responditSB,
but the causal nexus seems needed here. l. 11 divinaHSB: divinoe TE.
3 11, l. 5 modo: orn. by H, Madv. and others, but in view of the terms
of the law, the word cannot be spared; it is constantly contracted and
would easily fall out after non (ner). The sense is “does not merely for·
bid homicide, but forbids a man to wear a weapon for the purpose of
committing homicide.” Here the form non modo...sed seems to fulfil its
ordinary function of marking the passage from a wider idea to a narrower
one. Homicide is not forbidden altogether, but in certain cases only.
514, l. 13 nisi vero aut eto: the text of the sentence is dubious. H
omits in before quo (given by other iuss) 3 rightly, according to Cicero's
usage. All uss give non before etiamsi, as well as before ormo. H
omits quo before arma and is followed by Madv.; but orma thus becomes
subject to volnerarent, and the arms of S. cannot well form an ex.
of defensio contra vioe. All edd. excepting Eberhard have construed
ere p. with oppressa sunt; but etiam sie rep. clearly form a parenthesis
(see expl. n). Mr Clark with H omits e; but Cic. would hardly write
rep. oppressa arnt. ς 15, l. a at patet: so ὃς apparet HT; ot

the comma before argumentis, which seems to belong to expono rather
than to perspicere. 5 14, l. 7 anno superiore: possibly a gloss.

given by our uss in Cicero’s speeches alone about 400 times, yet dein
occurs in only about six places with good support; viz. these three, and
three others. It is more likely that the uss are wrong (especially as
deinde is greatly subject to contractiori) than that Cic. should have thu's
