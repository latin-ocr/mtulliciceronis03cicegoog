§nn ’

16 maneam no debilem: so Pro Rabir. perd. r. 44 and elsewhere.

17 summo consensu: “with entire unanimity”; cf. Ad Att. 1, 16, 5
summo decom bonorum.

48 lieri: “that he was being voted fnr’' (34, l. 14); like the common
phrase facio te consulem “1 vote for you ns consul.”

4ο umeris sustineret: a proverbial phrase; cf. Amin. Marc. 16, 3, 3
bellorum inundantium molem umeris suis, quod dicitur, velient.

44 nrum: ie. representatives of the tribes were summoned to enroll
themselves as canvassers and to receive bribes. Those enrolled were
organised into collegio or sodalitia, apparently one for each tribe (though
the collegio of Clodius are sometimes supposed to have been compito-
liciu). The process is called in Pro Planc. 45 decurcbtio tn'lulium,
and (by a phrase proper to the censors) discriptio populi ; cf. ib. 47, and
Pro Sest. 34. These collegia were based on the pretence of joining in
some religious rite.

se interponebat: he acted openly as bribery·agent (sequester, Pro
Planc. 45), a function generally left to men of low rank.
⁴ collinam novans: Clodius is compared with the censors, who some-
times altered the boundaries of the old tribes3 thus a nova Claudio
tribus was joined with the uuus Claudio to form one tribe (Liv. 4, 46, 5).
The nume noua Collina here is a reminiscence of this. The order of
voting among the tribes was breed, and of the four city tribes the Collina
voted last. In Pro Sest. 114 the Palatina is marked out as the turbulent
tribe.

44 conscribebat: so Pro Sest. 55 ut...collegrio conscriberentur ; Pro
Dom. 54 cum...conscribebas nou modo liberos sed etiam seruos ; Ad Qnir.
13 homines conscribi centuriarique (all of Clodius).

qnento pluro miscebat: “the more confusion he made ”3 like the
frequent expression omnia miscere “to produce general confusioni’

23 magis in dies: cotidie ringis is also often used, without difference in
sense.

44 paratissimus ein: a good ex. of Cicero's fondness for a heap of
superlatives.

45 certissmnr consulem: “quite sure to be consul''; so De Nat. D.
1, 37 ardorem, qui aether nominetur, certissimum deum iudicat “beyond
question god'’; Ad Qu. Fr. r, 4,4 certissimum matricidam ; Ad Att.
1, 1, rcertics coorpctitor.
