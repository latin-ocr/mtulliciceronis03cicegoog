154 PRO MIlONE ORATIO.

isuter utri insidmsfccedl (5 τι). The true answer, aether, must have
occurred to some jurymen3 but Cicero cannot afford to 'allow that the
meeting oi the combatants was accidental Β.. ΤίιοιιιςιιιιιιιιςΙ opens with
an effective descnptron oi the deadly enmrty which Clodius bore to

Milo, followed by references to the repeated announcements by Clodius
of his intention to make an end oi his ioe, and in particular ιο a waming
that he would die on or about the day of the actual encounter. Doubtless
the prosecuting oounsel quoted many such speeches which had fallen
from Milon. The events immediately preceding the battle, and the
incidents oi the engagement, are told rapidly and simply, and with a
skill which' ancient and modern critice alike have admired¹⁴. The
narrative of the fight is of course artisticelly coloured and embellished¹⁵.
f Itis boldly declared that Milo gave no order to his servants to put
Clodius to death, and that he was not on the spot when the deed was
done; but that they committed the act under the impression that their
master was already killed. Yet the act was “such as every man would
have desired his slaves to carry out in the like circumstances'’ (5 29)¹⁰.
The proois proper (πίστεις, argumenta) occupy 55 30—91. Ancient

ι writers divided prooss into two classes, those which do not depend on
oratoricul skill (πίστεις ἄτεχνοι), and those which do (πίστεις ἔντεχνοι).
The former consist mainly of testimony. The appeal ιο the testimony

os the Greeks in parallel cases (55 80-83) and to that oi the gods
(55 83-86) belong to “unartistic prooss,'' according to ancient ideas.
But remarkably little is said in this speech of anything which moderns
would regard as evidence. We must however remember that it is not
thes c which was delivered to the jury. It is apiece os literature,
and cols mainly with aspecta oi· the case which the writer judged likely
ιο be of interest to readersfl. The argumentative portion os the speech
opens with a reiteration oi the statement that the jury have only one
question to decide, viz. uter utri instillas ccerit (55 30. 31). It closes with

a picture ol the ruin which would have fallen the country had Clodius
”lived (55 87-91)¹⁸. There are two digressione intended to meet special
difficulties: (rlthe alle tion that Milo manumitted the slaves concemed
in the homicide, merep in order that they might not give evidence
against him (55 57-60) , (a) the belief that Pompey was determined to
