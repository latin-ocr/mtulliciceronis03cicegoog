94 PRO MILONE ORATIO. [ἓ 23—

rellcum eet ut: although est with a neuter adjective is generally

followed by infin, yet there are numerous exx. oi the rat-clause, which is
indeed regular in this particular phrase (36, l. 16) ; so restat ut, relinqui-
tur ut, superest ut, the infin. with these verbs being late or poetic.

3 uter...fecer1tr see App. B.

4 umentia “prools,'' not “arguments'’ a sense which the word
never bears in good Latin. Cf. n. on 61, l. 19· ⁴

5 diligenter: “carefully,” “minutely,’' as always; not ‘⁶ diligently. ’'

Μ.

6 muneraret Introd. 54.

7 anno superlore: a curious phrase, as the comitia did not take place
at all in the annus superior, but only in July oi the following year. See
crit. n. (App. C).

9 gradum: ci. ‘⁴ step '¹ as often used oi military promotion. The ordi·
nary man would have been content with the title praetorius “past-
praetor,'' which raised a man’s rank in the senate and (save that it was
not hereditary) was like the gain os a higher title in our peerage.

rc collegam: “as colleague.”

ta annum suum: “his proper year”; similarly De Leg. Agr. a. 33 De
Off. a, 593 AdFam. 10, 25,aand ra, a, a. Thephraseisusedintwo
ways, (1) oi the earliest year in which it was possible by law ior a manto
hold a particular office, (a) oi the year succeeding the minimum interval
(biennium) which the law interposed between the tenores of two higher
magistracies. The latter is the meaning in Ad Fam. l. l. As the date oi
the birth of Clodius cannot be determined‚ the meaning is uncertain bere.
He was aedile in 563 therefore 53 would be annus suus sothim on the
second interpretation, but it may have been annus suus according to the
other also.

¹3 religione utque: either because the pretence sor stopping the
elections was usually the announcement of an unfavourable omen,
or because the interruption to the election was in itseli deemed an
uniavourable omen.

quod: sor the more usual ut because of the neamess of another ut:
yet see 25, l. ao.
¹4 hoc eut: like id est, osten introduces a correction: “or rather” 3 see
my n. on Academ. 1, 32.
'a‘ plenum...tntegrum: often together, as Liv. 34, 22, 12.
