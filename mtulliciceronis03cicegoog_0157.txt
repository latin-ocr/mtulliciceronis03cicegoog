many of the brightest intellects of Greece and Rome¹. Coming 10
minuter details, the student was practised in highly technical rules
embracing all types of argument and all forms of expression, which it
might be expedient to em loy in any 1111111010350. His wits were
sharpened by criticism of emes, oral and written, premeditated and
externpore, and infinite labour was t on the acquisition of 3 good
delivery. Cicero himself studied r etoric and oratory in all their
minutiae, during almost the whole of his life. His rhetorical treatises
and speechcs were a store for later writers, and particularly Quintilian.
They made larger drafts on the speech for Milo than on an other of
Cicero's orations¹. It contains indeed hardly 3 clause whi has not
been consciously framed with the precepts of the art rhetorical in view.
My space, however, forbids that attention should be drawn to more than
3 few of the most prominent proofs which it affords of the orator's
03 3011 .

Ρ111 d defensive speech, the most important thing was to determine
the issue on which the case was to bc contested, or, as the phrase went,
to determine the “condition of the case'’ (5101111 causae, 0015111330
causae, στάσις). The 1301 that Clodius was 513111 in 3113035 with Milo
was undeniable. Ι1 only remained 10 justify the slaying by some means
or other. Cicero chooses to argue that Clodius laid a 113ρὶ01 Milo and
carrinensi.. thure restingueret 111 ,
ground taken 10 be too low, wrote and published 3 speech (known to
Quintilian) in which he maintained that, for freeing his country 01 311
unendurable pest, Milo merited, not punishment, but thanks and reward⁴.
Although Cicero repeatedly insists that he does not put forward this
claim on his client's hehalf, yet he loses no op ortnnity for craftily
insinnating into the minds of the jury (or rather of his readers) the idea
that Milo deserved to enjoy the benerit of the claiml. The issue raised
in the speech is therefore rimarily one of law rather than of 1301 ; and
yet an issue of fact is involved, for only by facts or inferences from facts
can it be shown that Milo merely killed a would-be assassin⁰.

The speech has three principal divisions ς· the proem (55 1-13); the
main argument (ἐς 23-91) and the peroration (ἐξ 92-105). Cicero
himself carefully marks out the middle division as containing the essence
01 his case, by applying to it the word causa and to the other two
divisions the phrase extra 0011101117.
