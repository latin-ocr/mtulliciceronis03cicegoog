APPENDIX B. 153

κ ’· The proem is unusually long, and wisely so, in view of the lormidable
f‘dilhcnlties which beset the casel. The function of an introduction was
l to dispose the listener to give a favourable hearing to the arguments3 to
* win his good will, to arouse his attention, and to make him ready to
-seceive instruction. Cicero strives to remove sour serious obstacles:

(a) the sear caused by the presence ol armed soldiers in court, (b) the

impression that the slaying os Clodius was peculiarly atrocious in its

circumstances, (c) the idea that the senate had prejudged the case and
found Milo guilty, (d) the persuasion that Pompey desired a conviction.

In the handling os all these points the orator exhibits supreme skilll.

The first section of the proem (ἓξ 1—6) was of course written in part as

a desence ol the timidlty which Cicero exhibited at the time ol the trial.

In the second section' (ἐξ 7-11) the doctrine that killing is not always

murder is ensorced by appeal to history, law mythology, and social

usage. The phrases and words throughout are caresully chosen so as
to instil imperceptibly the notion that Clodius was hoist with his own
petard. It would be easy to find flaws in the demonstration. The

Comelian law first lorbade homicide absolutely. It then condemned

the lesser offense of carrying a weapon with intent to kill. Hence it is

words Cicero strikes the keynote of the whole defence: insidiatorem
interfici iure posse. The third section (ἐξ 12-14) endeavours to prove
that the senate had leit the uestion of Milo's guilt entirely open. A
bold contention, seeing that decrees such as the senate had passed on
the death os Clodius were only adopted on rare occasions, and when
*public indignation was strongly aroused. The fourth point was most
awkward to treat. First Cicero declares that if Pompey had wished to
destroy Milo, he would have taken other means. Then we have a bitter
complaint that any special commission should have been set up, but

Pompey is not directly blamed. Next the bloodguiltiness of Clodius

himsel
Pompeyis artfully pressed to the front. Pompey's motives for establish-
ing the special court are so described as to leave the impression that
they were utterly inadequate. The proem ends with flattery of the jury
and the judge. Such honourable men would never have been chosen to
try the case had not Pompey desired that they should pronounce upon
it freely and without bias.

After the proem comes the recital of facts (διήγησις, narratio).
&he ualities required in this part of a speech are lucidity, brevity,

is depicted, and the desire which he once had even to kill

lausi ilityu. First an enumeratiou is given ol the points already
made, and it is roundly asserted that the only question before the court

showing how sirtlsully its tunes vary from clause to clause.
