27 nullo ut: in Cic. ut rarely precedes the negative.
29 emet conquietura: n. on 48, l. 5.
ne tete...oesuss0t: the affirmative ne· is nearly always followed
immediately by a pronoun‚ and introduces the apodosis of a conditional
sentence. For ne iste laud cf. netu lrarulin Fam. 7, 1, 33 ne illc non
in De Senect. 33.
tete: far oftener applied by a speaker to his opponent than to his
client. Halm quotes parallels from Pro Clu. τοις Pro Plane. 99.
haud: the use of this word is sornewhat restricted. Its chief employ-
ment is with acto· it rarely accompanies other verbs. Itis found with a
few adjectives and adverbs ς and it always negatives merely the one word
with which it is joined.

P. 52.

r 1³ qul: instead of a merely descriptive clause, tlre causal qui
with the subj. might have been expected here. So in 70, 1. 19 qui
tulit.

to the general drift of the sentence, as in Pro Mur. 62, aud elsewhere.

ettam: “actually‚’' like rut in Greek ; as in 3, l. 14.

ἕ 89.

3 voluntte: the allusion is to the stone sphere, on which a statue of
F ortune in ancient tirnes was often poised‚ rather than to the wheel
ol the goddess (In Pis. aa fortunae rotam). Cf. Pacuvius ap. Ad
Herenn. a, 36 surranum insanam esse et caecam et brutam perhibent
philosophi Ι saxoque instare in globoso perhibent volubili; Ovid. Ex
Ponto a, 3, 56 stantis in orbe deoe; Cic. De Div. a, 15 volubilitate
fhrtunae.

4 quum: the succession quantoe quam quantae quantae is curious.
Perhaps quantae ct quom is the true reading.

7 et...d1es:1‚l.6n.

salutaribus rebus tutu: these words, often suspected, are quite
souud3 cf. Ad Att. 9, rr, 4 et haecperdilo suntet illu non salutaria.

8 ut spero: parenthetic spero without ut does not occur in Cic.. though
opinor is common.

motu...t0mporum: so inclinatio communium temporum (“national
