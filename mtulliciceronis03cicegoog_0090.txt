intermortuae: “made between death and lile.'’ Intermortuus is pro·
perly applied to a person at the point of death; so Liv. 37, 53, 10 in
utra contione intermortuus houd multo post exspiravit ; and Sueton. Ner.
42. A slight difficulty is caused by the plural contiones and cotidie, since
intermortuae should strictly apply only to the day oi the buming. But
Cic. supposes the “dead and alive” condition to continue alter that day.
aa patenum: “ascendency,'' power testing on no public authority,
whereas potestas is power conserred by office. Auctoritas isinfluence
derived from character or experience; gratia influence due to private
friendships.
invidiose: not “enviously‚'' but “so as to excite odium.'’
a hos: here generic; not “these” but “such as these.''
²7 officiosos: not “officium'’ (a meaning the Latin word never has) but
“devoted” Officium is primarily service done or due to kin or country·
men or others who have like claims. Here Cic. is thinking os his clients.
meos...nos: this sudden change irum first pers. sing. to first pers.
plur. used oi the speaker is often met with; see my n. on Academ. 1, 1.
²9 paucorum: in good Latin the passive of perdo occurs only in the
participle, excepting perdatur in Hor. sat. a, 6, 59, where it may be
spurious. The passive is replaced by perire, interire and the like.

ἓ 13. Ρ. 30.

1 non est iniqua: a sop to Pompey.
² quaestiones vel...ve1: with “either'’ and “or'‘ English idiom would
require the singular (erat quaestio). For a similar irregularity seen. on
14, l. 16 vulnerarunt.
de medo: above, 11, l. 5.
3 do vi: under the lex Plautia of 78 B.c.; cf. Pitt Press ed. ol Pro
Sulla, Introd. p. 23 sq.

this special court.
maurorum...1uutum: these words are osten put together, asin Sall.

Iug. 14, 15 claust iu tenebris utut utoerorc et luctu ; cf. below, 16, ll. 18, ,
⁴213 ao, l. 30 ; sometimes dolor, maeror, luctus all occur in the same

sentence3 so Pro Balb. 61 and Tac. An. 3, 6conveuisso recenti dolori
luctum et ex maerore solacio. Dolor is grief as felt at the heart, moeror

as expressed by the condition or action oi the sufferet, for example hy
the gloom on his face or by his tears; luctus by material signs, as in the
dress. Cf. Tusc. 4, 18 luctus aegritudo ox cius qui carusjuerr‘t interitu
