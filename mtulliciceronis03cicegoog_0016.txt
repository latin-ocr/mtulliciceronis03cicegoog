Milo and one or two other friends who had adopted the policy
of meeting force by force. On one occasion Mark Antony‚ the
future triumvir, nearly succeeded in killing clodiusl.

4 Doubtless at some time in the interval Milo held the
office of praetor, but no record of his tenure has been preserved.
During the latter half of the year 53 there were three candidates

who carried on a furious competition for the office of consult
These were Milo, P. Plautius HypsaeuS, one of Pompey's officers
during the third Mithridatic war3, and Q. Metellus Scipio Nasica,
father-in-law of Pompey, who married his daughter after the
death of Caesar’s daughter Julia⁴. Pompey had been a friend
and political ally of Milo, bnt he threw all his influence into the
scale in favour of Scipio and Plautius. who were united in their
candidature⁵. Clodius, now on good terms with Pompey, strove
strenuously in the same cause. He was himself a candidate for·
the praetorship, and would have found it intolerable to hold the
office with Milo in the consul's chair. Money was freely lavished
and blood was freely shed in the course of the struggle. Such

through. Milo’s bribery, direct and indirect, had been on a
magnificent scale⁰, and had won the favour of the people ; the
delay was mainly due to his opponents⁷.

ordinary magistrates to take the place of those who had gone
out of office. On Dec. ιο preceding, new tribunes of the plebs
had begun their year, and in the absence of the executive officers
of state, held a position of more than usual importance3 in par-
ticular, meetings of the senate could only be held under their
presidency. According to ancient mle, the political arrangement
which was called the interregnum should have ensued The
method by which the first interrex was appointed is in some
