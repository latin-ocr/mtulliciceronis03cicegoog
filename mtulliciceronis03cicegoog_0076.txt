9 huius exitum ludici: when a pronoun and a noun are either· in
agreement with one another, or one oi them is dependent on the other,
Cic. often separates the two by just oue word, as here. See u· on Pro
Arch. 4 (Pitt Press ed). Δ

ιι romanu: at first sight the word seems to give an “anti-climax”
aster patna: nor is this to be got over by saying (as some edd. do say)
that fortunis is equivalent to sort⁸ rei publicae. But in Cic. fortunae
osten has a wider sense than that oi mere “possessions'’; it may well
mean “all that is precious to a man,'’ and may here sum up se, liberm,
patria. ef. Pro Plane. 79 agitur Cn. Planci salus patria fortunae.
homerum dies rather more emphatic than lendin so hesterno dz'e ior
heri aud crastino dic sor cras. Cic rarely uses hodiernus with any
other word than dies. Observe that hodierno die is not used in Latin
with the sense oi “to-day'' when the meaning is “in our time‚'' though
hodie does occur with that sense.
η uuum: very emphatic, as is indicated by its position at the beginning
nithe sentences “oue and only one.”
eorum: “it consists os those.'’ For· this explanatory gen. aster
genus, where in English we should pause and begin a new clause or
sentence, cf. Off. 1, 119 illud...maxime rarum genus est eorum qui...
13 ranmu...exitue: the ablatives are iustrumental: the robberies and
arsons aud tuin oi every kind inflicted on the commonwealth enabled
him to maintain both the bodies and the spirits of his crem. Speaking
oi this same crew Cic. says in Pro Sest. 99: qui discordiis civium et
seditione pascantur, and ib. 78: qui ab illo pestifero civi...rei pitblicae
sanguine saginantur.
omnibus: here=summin as iu the phrase omni supplicio (De Amic.
43)· ’ .
exitiis publicis: an exaggerated phrase like funera rei piaebluae
in Pro Sest. 88. Halm quotes Sall. orat. Lep. 25 maxima turbamenta
rei publicae atque exitia ,· cf. too De Leg. 1, 34 caput csse exitiorum
omnium (oi the tribunate).
¹4 etium: “actually”; not, “even now‚’' as suggested by some edd.
That is a sense in which Cic. does use umus, but a negative always
precedes as in nondum ctiam, nihildum etiam and occasionally nou
etiam (Tusc. 1, η).
15 praeirent: only here in Cic os dictating a form oi words. Livy
and later writers use praeire with an accusative, as verba, sacramentum.
quatuorcentis: “what decision you were to give.” Since the
decision was still to come, iudicetis might have heen aulost'uutehier
