it. But Opimius and Marius both had similar authority from the
senate. Tube consistent here, cic. should either have substituted the
name of the senate for those oi Marius and Opimius or have written
ego instead of me consule senatus.

9 interfici netu esset: with impersonal verbs aud phrases, the passive
rather than the active infin. follows, where the circumstances allow of
a choice between the two, as is mostly the case. Cf. 34, ll. ro, ra.

. doctinam! hommes: “the greatest poets.” The reference is mainly
to Aeschylus, but other great poets also handled the story os Orestes
memoriae prouiderunt: “have handed on to aiter times”; a
common phrase, ci prodere monumentis (De Leg. 1, 62) and tradere
‚memoriae (Paradoxa n3). In a few passages we find proditum est
numoria (Cic. Verr. a, r, 473 Caes. Β. G. 5, 123 Liv. 40, 29, a) where
memorre is taken tomeun “by tradition ”3 but the expression is pro·
bably not Latin, memoria being an error for menzon'as.

ro* vanuum “being at variance,” ie. evenly divided (see next note).
The verb vadare occurs here only in Cicero’s speeches, and I have
found'no ex. elsewhere os this sense, though in De F in. 5, 12 we have
variari [rom an impersonal vomatur (of opinion). Livy would probably
have written variantibus, but the use oi variare as a neuter verb is
later than Cicero.

non solum...11berahum: “was acquitted by the vote ol one who
was not merely a goddess, but a goddess preeminent for wisdom.’'
Uele. seems to have thought that Athena acquitted Orestes by giving
a casting vote, and uo doubt the phrase “vote oi Atheua'' (ψῆφος
’Δθάνας), which became proverbial, was used lo mean a casting vote.
But in the “Eumenides” of Aeschylus, the opinions of the court uf
Areopagus which tried Orestes are not evenly divided. There would
have been a majority osone lor a verdict of “ guilty,” had not the god·
dess cast her vote into the urn in favour of acquittal. She states that
Orestes wins even if the votes be equal (Eum. 741: vird δ’ Ὀρέστης,
κᾶν ἰσόψηφος κριθῇ). Dio Cassius 51, 19, 7, speaking of the powers of
Augustus, says that he assumed the right to give something like the “vote
of Atheua” (ὥσπερ ψῆφον Ἀθηνᾶς) in criminal trials, but no instances
ol its exercise by the emperors are on record. [Possibly Dio is merely
alluding to the power of pardon exercised by the emperor in virtue
ol his tribunicia potestas. For the phrase calculus Minervae often used
inmodem books 1 have found no ancient authority]
