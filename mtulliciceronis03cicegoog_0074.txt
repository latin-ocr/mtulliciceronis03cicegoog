ga] Ι 'NOTES 69

13 ei operata puerone the omission of esse is usual with verbs of
thinking, speaking and the like. Pompey was notoriously at this time
opposed to Milo, aud the citizens might well think that the troops were
posted to secure Milo's conviction.

14 cederem amnon: “I should bow to the storm.“ Tempus is often
applied, like recipie, to a critical or important moment. So Ad Fam. 4,
9, a tempori cedere, fd est necessitati parere ,· and below, 16, l. 13·

tantam munorum: “suchapowerful'force'k so Sall. Cat. 48, 5
tanta vis heminis “such a powetful man.” Similar concrete uses of
abstract words are common both in Greek and in Latin; cs. a, p. 26,1. 1
temeritatem concitatae multitudinis “a reckless and excited crowd ”3 ’
3, l. 131³. Clodifurar “that madman P. Clodius''; also 3, l. ro virtuti
Milomh. The subtlety of tantam vim after cantra vim in l. 10 should
be remarked.

15 locum: if the endings of sentences or of clauses followed by one of
the longer stops which occur in the course of the speech be examined,
it will be seen that in about three instances out of four, the concluding
word isa verb; and this is about the usual proportion throughout
Cicero's writings. A word placed at the end ofa sentence naturally
strikes the attention more than another, and if it be not in some way
emphatic, the sentence will be felt to end weakly. The verb has usually
most emphasis thrown upon it, and therefore it naturally falls into the
last place. Next to the verb,a substantive most frequently ends the
sentence. In writing prose composition the student should avoid con·
cluding with an adjective or an adverb unless the sense allows a special
stress to be laid upon it. What has been said about the endings of
prose sentences may almost equally be said about the endings of lines
of verse.

remeat et renus: the two verbs occur together elsewhere, as Pro
Planc. a. Cic. is particularly fond of pairing in this way words of
almost identical meaning. So below, 42, l. 43 43, h 6. Some such
pairs occur so frequently, not only in Cic. but in other authors, that
they may be regarded as tixed expressions of the Latin language; for
example, emendare et corrigere aud liberet solutus. Cf. 6, l. 15 n.;
3,l. 2611.

16 9untenusatnrt...tmttsetmt...tust1ttas...aaptenttae: an example of
chiasmus, whereby four words, consisting of two pairs, which we may
denote by ,Μ’ and BB', are arranged in the order ABB‘A'. The word
clarbsmas is connected with the Greek letter χ, and indicates a “cross
arrangement.” Cicero't fondness for this form may *oe seen imm em
