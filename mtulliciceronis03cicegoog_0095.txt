90 PRO MILONE ORATIO. [516-

supply the answer to such a question for themselves, but ancient orators

almost always answered their own rhetorical questions. Ci. 31, p. 37,
l. r.

arr. ⁶

a 5 allo...atlo= more forcible than alab atque.
26 interut inter: “granted the difference between.”
ay et poeula tencatur at legibue: a word or phrase which (like teneatur
here) stands in the same relation towards two other words or phrases,
is often thus placed between them. The usage is called by the old
grammarians coniunctio. Cf. 24,L 153 29, l. 31 ; 36,1. 25 ; 42, ll. a, 43
47» l· 3¹·
30 artie “shall be deemed.’'
monumentis: merely denotas the road‚ as the singular does in 37,
p. 4ο, l. 5. So the temple consecrated to Honos and Virtus by Marius
is frequently denoted by the name monumentum Mari.
malorum auorum: only the oid Appius Caecus, censor in 312, who
made the mad, is meant; the plural maiores is loosely used of one
ancestor just as liberi is often employed of one child; neither word, when
used in the particular sense, has any singular. So posteri below.
eat interiectus: see cr. n. (App. C).

ἕ 18. P. 82.

1 omananmum: “most distinguished.'’ He was probablya leading

Clodius in the middle of the description ol his victim is artistic.

5 magnanon: “tragic woes'’; cl. Tusc. 4, 73 quas tragoedias tffica‘t;
De Orat. a, 205 tragoedias agere in nugis “to make woesul tragedies out
ol trifles.” There are similar uses ol τραγῳδία, τραγῳδεῖν.

quaa mannia eta: “there was no whisper about it aloretime when
it was reddened by the slaughter ol an upright and unblemished man,
but now it has been stained with the blood oia brigand aud assassin its
name is on many tongues.'’ Cruentata is stronger than imbuta, sor
which see n. on ιο, 1. 32. ι

6 usurpatum the verb is especially applied to the use of words.

7 parricidae: non 86, p. 59,l. 9.
