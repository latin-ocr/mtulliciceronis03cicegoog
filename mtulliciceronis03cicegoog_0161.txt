156 Pro MILONE ormo.

have been the usage of Cicero himself, so far as that can be ascertained
by strong probabilities. Thus for example I have written -i not ·ie' in
getfiemtives of nonus whose nominatives end in ius or ium3 ·r's not -es

e accusatives plural of r'·stenrs‚ and vo not vu, propincus not pro·
pinquus3 poenire etc. not punire ; duos not duo. In many cases where
the indications are slighter, entire consistency is hardly attainable.

The following are the principal uss on which the text is based:

P=a Turio palimpsest‚ of which only small porticus are preserved.
It presents a better· text than any other ΜΞ. ’

E=Erfurtensis, of the xtrth cent, now in Berlin.

T=Tegernseensis of the xlth cent, now in Munich.

S=Salisburgensis, of the xvth cent, now in Munich.

B=Barberinus, of the x111th cent. This Ms was known to
Garatoni, and its readings have now been given by Nohl.

H=Harleianus‚ now in the British Museum, of the end of the xlth
cent. It was formerly at Cologne, and sorne of its readings were
reported (somewhat imperfectly) by Modiin, Gulielmius and Graevius.
Its whole history has been made out, and its lections have been pub·
lished by Mr Clark ol Queen’s College, Oxford, in a valuable work
which forms Part vu of the Auscdota Oxoniensr'a (Classical series).
There is a gap in H between θ 18, l. 5 quae and ᾗ 37, l. ²9 rerfici (sic).

The most important critical editions of the Pro Milone which have
appeared in recent times are (ι) that by Baiter in the edition of Cicero‘s
auu attenuatione. mun wirma

· · · s r
series, 18 a.

On rtielwhole, editors have been guided mainly by E. Many
scholars (including Madvig) have attributed high importance to those
lections of H which were known to them. It has a close affinity with
E, but is still more closely related to 83 and HS agree more closely
with P than E does. Nohl has given bis opinion of H in an appendix
to his revision of Richter and Eberhard's edition (Teubner annotated
series, 1892). He seems to depreciate the rus somewhat unduly, on
the strength of errors which it shares with other ross, but admits that
where, as is often the case, E and TBS are divided, the testimony of H
is generally decisive.

I have derived much benefit from Mr Clark’s excellent work, but
cannot agree with him that the text of the speech is “honeycombed
with glosses.” Sume there are, no doubt3 but part of the evidence ou
which he relies, such as the perturbed order of words in the iuss,
accompanied by a possibility of excision‚ is treacherous.

§a l.9 nec: Mss non, corr. by Garat. Madv. l. 10 quo: 1 have
added the word, omitting oratori or oratione (given by tiss). Τὴε
words ut...iudlcio are clearly parenthetic; therefore something has fallen
out which accounted for the snbj. possimus. The expression adferre
aliquid, quo foll. by snbj. is found elsewhere; cf. Fin. 1, 723 3, 113
Tusc. 5, ao. l. 16 iustissimi: so H ; other Mss illustrissimi 53,
l. 18 prae: so HE; pro cett„ which ill suits neglegere. ξε, l. ²9

come into dte text from a marginal variant on nobba “vel vota?
