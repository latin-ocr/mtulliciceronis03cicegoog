He and all who had retained any preference for orderly govern-
ment rejoiced at the removal of an intolerable pest. But the
manner of it was so cruel and cold·blooded as to arouse strong
indignation even among those who bore Clodius no affection.

taken to the house of Clodius on the Palatine hill, close by the
forum. Fulvia, the widoW‚ displayed it, in all its piteous plight,
in the hall of the dweIhng, whither crowds thronged to gaze upon
it. The excitement grew stronger on the following day. A
huge mob assembled before the house, led by a few well-known
men, among them two tribunes who were determined opponents

were placed when they conducted business in the forum. The
senate-house was burned down, and the Basilica Porcia next it,

originally built by Cato the Censor, received damage from the
fire. A somewhat similar and still more famous scene was
enacted near the same spot eight years later when the body of
the mighty Caesar was burned in the same tumultuous fashion.
