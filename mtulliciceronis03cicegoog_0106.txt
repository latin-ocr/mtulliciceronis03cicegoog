libranum: canok-casem an exaggeration for capsa (a despatchbox
or desk). Cic. does not employ scrinium, so commonia later times.
Librariolrh in De Leg- 1, 7 is probably a dimin. of this, not of librarius
(as edd. and dictt. say).

25 Palladium: the allusion is not to the robbery of the shrine of Pallas
in Troy by UlysseS, but to the rescue from buming Troy of the image of
the goddess by Aeneas.

26 videlicet: here ironioel, like scilt'cet in 57, l. 3.

28 admont: the change from the second person to the third is striking,
but not unexampled. The sentence is a sort of “aside” addressed to
the audience. There are changes still more remarkable in Iu Pis. 78;
cf. too Phil. a, 43 where an “aside” to the jury is similarly interposed
in the course of an address to the opponeut; so Phil. 8, ἕξ 17, 18. [See
crit. n.]

oeulis: “glauce'’ as often.

²9 omnibus omnia: the collocation of different parts of omnisis
frequent both iu prose and in verse. Cic. is alluding, 1 think, to the
time of the funeral of Clodius, not (as most edd. say) to the events of
&mmm

P. 88.

1 lumen onrlw the reference is to the borning of tbe senate-house.
Whether there is also a play on the meaning of lumen explained in n.
on nr, p. 33, l. 8, is doubtful. The two senses may thus be combined:
“I am of course impressed by the shining light of the senate-house.'’

quid? This little anticipative question is almost always followed
(like ri δέ 3) by a second question.

tu me ttbt: the pronouns tend to come together in Latin3 so huic
ego vos in 37, p. 40, l. 3.

4 adame note that this word is, until the time of Silvet Latin,
usually applied to the dead bodies of despised roeo, such as criminals
or slaves3 and cf. 91, l. 31·

5 martrinum the funeral ceremony for a man of rank was elaborate
aud was treated as a public affair. The representative of the deceased
(dominus ficareris) figured as a magistrate for the nonce3 the procession
was much like that which took place just before the games at the circus
(also called pompa). Musicians and wailing women went in from, then
came a train wearing the wax masks (foragines) of the deceased’s an·
ceston, with the gerb of the highest office which each had held in life.
