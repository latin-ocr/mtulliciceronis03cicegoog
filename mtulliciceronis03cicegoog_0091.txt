4 adferebat: attulit or attulerat would have been more natural.

5 :noento stupro: “foul profanation,'’ in connexion with ihe Bona Dea
(Intr. 5 1). Illo has the force of “notorious''

iudicium decemendi...potestas: the expression is curious. The

senate was not prevented from voting for a trial of Clodius, but a bill
brought forward by the consuls in pursuance of ihe decree, for the
purpose of establishing a special court, was prevented from passing by a
tribune, who afterwards carried abili of his own more favourable to
Clodius.

7 cur decreviti Introd. ἕ 11, and App. Β.

5 11.

13 nisivero: n. on8, l. 3. The words refer to optanda. For readings
here see crit. n. in App. C.

15 e re publica: the ultimate good to ihe country is pitted against the
temporary harm, which is contra rem publicam (l. 11). The words c re
parblica take the place of an adverb here and in Phil. 11, 11 benecia rep.
iudicare, and De Orat. 1, 124 multas e rc p. seditioms saepe csse factas ;
but the force is adjectival in the frequent phrases civis c rep. “a patriotic
citizen'' and hoc e rep. cst “this is a patriotic action.’' E reis used by
Plaut. and Ter. as the opposite of ab rc (“away from the purpose ”). In
De Leg. 1, 59 we have c natura “in accordance with nature.”

16 remoramur: the plural in spite of the fact that aut goes with each
of the three subjects to the verb. Parallels are to be found here and
there, in connexion with veland neque, as well as aut (see 13, l. 1).

decrevi: “the meaning of my vote was etc.” Decerne was one of
the words employed by the individual senator in giving his answer when
called on for an opinion by the consul or other president. See eg.
Phil. 9, 13 and 14, 19.

17 Appia: without vri: as in 18, p. 31, l. 43 so Hor. sat. 1, 5, 6 :trinus
est gravis Appia tardis

18 inesset vis et insidiae: the verb, as often, is made to agree with the
nearer noun only ; cf. 13, p. 34,1. 1 ; 67, l. 11.

19 vie: i.e. offensive violence, not defensive.

11 haberemus: “we should not have now”; habuissemus would have
conveyed the meaning “we should never have had a new court.’'

11 extra ordinem: ie. that the trial should not wait its turn with others.
The phrase extra ord. was used of any departure from rule. Thus a
civil suit is said to be heard ext. ord. when the praetor tries it out to :he

end mmseis, a thing which rarely happened. See Iunone 11.
