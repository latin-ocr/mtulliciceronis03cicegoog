must have been supreme in the earliest days. So the senate is osten

called consiliunt, being in theory a gathering of advisers to the consuls.

4 motu: il is rather strange to find this word applied to the classes
which are called amplissimi in 4, 1. 22 andflorentissimi in ar, 1. 8. For
these ordines cf. Introd. p. 19, and t'or reading, crit. n. in App. C.

5 spem...ao= a rare construction3 probably adopted in place ol the
genitive because genitives close to inimicoswould have been inelegantis
not ambiguous. Where ad with the accusative replaees the genitive
some such motive is usually at work. Thus in Ad Att. 15, ao, statatum
spei haben od vehendum, a second genitive vivendi would have been
obviously awkward3 and iu Pro Sest. 4² Cic. writes cantores ad
pemt'ciem meam because the gen of pernicies was not in use. Observe
that the prepositiou is not repeated with gloriam ,· t'or this see n. ou ro,
l. 3²·

6 non modo...!ed etiarn: “not merely...but even.'' So in 4²· l. 3²·

mutem: here, as olten (like caput), ol civil rights, which were at
stake3 see Introd. p. 23, and ct'. 38, l. 19. Similarly incolumis is often
applied to one who has escaped from a criminal trial

7 taus viros: a phrase often used by Cic. in his speeches os the jury.
The insertion ol prr talis viros here aller sed etiam is curious, since the
description of the jury given before applies both to the clause with non
modo and to that with sedetiam.

§a
qumquam: ‘⁸ and yet ’' (like καίτοι) asin 70,l. rt ς 76,1. πός 82,
l. 7· There isa similar use ol etsi at the beginning ol a sentence (ιι,
l. 4), but not os quamvis
8 rebusque...testls: “the t‘act that everything he did was to lreep his
country from harm.''
9 miminis: objective genitive; “ desence against this charge'’; as 58.
l. η destrueres necis.
abutamur: in the Latin of the Ciceronian period abuti never in
itself means “to abuse,” but only “ to use to the utmost,'’ “to use up·¹’
But the context sometimes leads up to the meaning “to abuse,’' as eg.
in Pro S. Rosc. 54 legibus...abuti adquaestum ac libidinem·
ro nist oculis videtitis: a strong expression; elsewhere Cic. employs
modified phrases like tamquam oculas vellere, or omlis paene videre.
or temere oculis vi deri. Cf. Pro S. Rosc. 98 non versatur ante oculos
vobe's in coede Glaucia?
11 ut ctlmeu...condonetls: lit. ‘⁸ to ‚make nre a present ultre marsal*
