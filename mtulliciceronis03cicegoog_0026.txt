INTRODUCTION. , 21

81 jurymen were drawn, 27 from each of the three orders ; the
remainder were released from attendance. The 81 immediately
took their seats on the bench and listened to the arguments of
counsel ; then they were reduced to 51 by challenges. The
prosecuting counsel were by the law granted two hours‚ and
those sor the delence three. ln a trial before¹ Pompey’s legis·
lation took effect, the time allotted would have been con·
siderably greater¹. Against Milo spoke the elder of the
two Appii Claudii, and two assistants (subscriptores) named
M. Antonius (not the famous Mark Antony) and P. Valerius

forum was intense. On the first os the three days set apart sor
the witnesses, Causinius Schola (see ἓ 6, above) deposed to the
crueltyos Milo’s deed. One of Cicero’s assistants‚ M. Marcellus,
roseto eroes-examine. This was the signal for an uproar on the
side of the Clodian fection, and Marcellae, alarmed, took refuge
on the judgment-seat (trz’bunal) of the president of the court³.
Milo then demanded a military guard which should secure all
concerned in the case against violence. Pompey‚ who watched
the trial from a position at some little distance, was seriously
frightened, and brought down next day a force sufficient to
overawe the multitude. Many men os Bovillae then testified to
the incidents os the massacre, how the tavern was stormed‚ the
innkeeper killed, and the body of· Clodius flung on to the road.
Some priestesses of a shrine on the Alban mount told a strange
tale of a mysterious woman who appeared to lulfil at the shrine
a vow undertaken in view of the murder os Clodius⁴. The last
witnesses were Fulvia, the widow of Clodius, and her mother
