patronus did his cla'ens in the old days. Cf. Suet. Tib. 3 (of the elder
Drusus) ob caiatiam adversus Gracchos operam patronus serratus dictus,
which is possibly a reminiscence ol our passage, slightly misapplied3
particularly as in the context Suet. copies another passage ol Cic.
relating to the younger Drusus (Pro'l'lanc. 33 multa in re publica arro·
lz'ens). So tutor, tutela reipublicae sometimes occur (De Orat. 3, 3; Ad
Quir. ιι). But pomanus may mean here “advocate '¹ or “mouthpiece'’
asin 39, l. 243 cf. Liv. epit. 71 Drusus...ut maioribus viribus senatus
causam susceptam tueretur.
avonculus: Livia the sister of this Drusus (the younger) was twice
married. Cato ol Utica was her son by her first marriage; by her
second husband Q. Servilius Caepio she had a daughter Servilia who
was mother of M. Brutus, the murderer of Caesar.
16 tribunusplebis: emphatic, as Drusus was slain during his tribunate,
in spite oi his potestas being sacrosancta.
17 nihil: lor non, found at all periods of Latin ; as in old English
“nothing” lor “not” Above, 14, l. ²4·
consultum cumulare senatum is regular, consulere populum rare3 see
De Rep. a, 3¹ and 383 De Dour. 53. Est is easily supplied sor consultus
from mereto cst; so 33, p. 34, l. ις 28, l. 16. Cic. does not usually put
the participle alone for the perf. pass. tense, as poets and later prose
writers dot nor does he omit the substantive verb with the gerundive; ,
cf. 33, l. 19.
ro nocttune. vlo: Carbo (above, 8, ll. 3, 4) and C. Gracchus were
suspected oi murdering the younger Africanus. But Laelius, the most
intimate friend of Africanus, believed the death to be natural, and Cic.
elsewhere (De Amic. 12) speaks of the theory os violence as a mere
suspicion. Charges of murder were readily made in ancient times when
the cause of a death was not apparent.
ar co1ore..'.exspectatam esse: the infin. is dependent on something
suppressed, “ grief at the thought that...” There are many exx. in Cic.
and other writers ol the accusative with infinitive tacked on to a sub-
stantive in this elliptic way. Cf. eg. De Nat. D. a, rr litteras...misit
se recordatum essc (i. e. quibus nuntiabat etc.) and below 33, l. 20.
aa cuperent: n. on 33, l. 28 vellemus.
ueveuarlum mortem: not exactly “natural death'' (ie. death due
to disease or decay), as some scholars say, but a death not purposely
hastened by human violence. Mors naturalis first occurs in the elder
Pliny.
24 certe nullu: a modern speaker would have leit the audxenee &n
