24 uuam...tneaulue: dederas documenta takes the same constr. that
mamas might have taken. Docere is similarly followedby an ut-clause
in Caes. and other writers. Quam in a dependent clause is very frequent
in cic. and has the meaning of quam valde, which is indeed sometimes
substitutediorit. ’
insanius plural, because Cic. has in mind many instances oi insanin.¹
Cic. has a particular fondness sor the plur. oi abstract nouus. According
to Draeger, Hist. Synt. ἕ 7, there ure 3814 abstract nouus in Latin, of
which about a 500 occur only in the singular.
tum ub mutescantta: some edd. have insisted (with Asc.) that Cic. is
alluding to events not more than six years old, and they quote the word
adulescentulus applied to Cacsar, when he was already praetor elect,
hy an aged‘and disappointed rival (Sallust. Cat. 49, a), a circumstance
which makes the illustration useless. No strict definition of adulescens
can of course be given ; but the word is not likely to be used oi a man
over 30 unless it specially denotes youthsuluess and unusual vigour.
