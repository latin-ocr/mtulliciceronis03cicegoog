meum: a brilliant letter of Cic. to Atticus (ι, ι6) shows the cor·

ιο Pompeio: 37, p. 40, l. 43 Ascon. 47.
ar oasdte etc: there is great exaggeration3 magistrates were wounded
(like Sestius) in the street fighting, but none killed ; and only one civis is
alleged to have been slaughtered by Clod. (18, p. 32, 1. a). Even he
lell in a general combat (Ascon. 47). Efficerat, not fecerat, because the
alleged deeds were not done by Clodius’ own hand.

unam: the senate had no direct control over the magistrates. cir-

the senate with magistrates3 see Mommsen, Staatsrecht ιιι. a, p. 1226
