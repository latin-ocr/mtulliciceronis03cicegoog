the second part, calling for a trial under the ordinary law,
was vetoed by two tribunes and so fell to the groundl. Pompey
therefore proceeded to lay his two new bills before the people.
It was in vain that Milo's friend Caelius Rufus declared the
proposed law de vi to be unconstitutional, because a law of
the Twelve Tables forbade statutes to be passed which were
directed against particular persons¹. A few years before, Cicero
had made a similar fruitless appeal against the law by which he
was driven into exile. Many wild rumours were afluat to Milo's
harm. The most absurd was a story told by a freedman of
Lepidus. When produced at a public meeting by Munatius
Plancus, this man declared that, with three other free persons,
he had come upon the scene while Clodius was being slain;
that they had cried out against the villany ; that they had been
seized and imprisoned for two months in one of Milo's country
houses. At one meeting of the senate there was a farcical
occurrence. A senator shouted that Milo had a weapon con-
cealed under his clothes, whereupon the accused disrobed him·
self and proved his accuser false. Pompey preferred to believe
the hostile tribunes, who declared him to be in danger from
Milo's machinations‚ and for the most part he shut himself up in
his suburban residence, under the protection of a strong guard³.
