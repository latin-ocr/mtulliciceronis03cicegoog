feeling on the part of the jury that the presence of Milo in
Rome menaced seriously the public peace. If this feeling had
not existed, even the influence of Pompey would scarcely have
secured so decisive a vote against'Milo. He must have had

many friends and sympathisers among the jury, who would
fain have pronounced him innocent if they could. Milo went
into exile, and on April 9 sentence was given against him in the
new court for trying cases of bribery (de ambitu) which was
established by Pompey's statute. A little later he was pro-
nounced guilty in the court for punishing illegal organisations
(dc sodaliciis), and again in the court which dealt with violence
under the ordinary law (de vt). Milo’s friend, L Saufeius, who
had led the attack on the inn at Bovillae, narrowly escaped con·
viction by the new court dc vi, and was more easily acquitted
by a jury who tried him for the same offence under the pre·
existing statute Saufeius was defended by Cicero in both
cases. Sextus Clodius, who was put on his trial before the
special commission, was almost unanimously condemned for
buming the body of Clodius in the senate-house3 and many
others were sentenced, the greater part being of the Clodian
faction. The special tribunal established by Pompey seems to
have made an honest endeavour to clear the city of the bullies
who had so long harassed it1.

rights, and banishment from Roman soil, but there was no con-
fiscation of the offenders property& The criminal was wiped
out from the number of Roman citizens, and should he return
to regions where Roman citizens dwelt, all were forbidden to
supply him with the two great necessaries of life, fire and water
(aquae ct tgna t'ntcrdictio); while to slay him would be no
offence against the law. ln early days, when Rome made
treaties with communities outside her boundaries, it was cus-
