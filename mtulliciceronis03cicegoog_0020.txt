On Jau. 26 the crowd gathered to celebrate the usual “nintlr
day feast '² in honour of the dead (cena novemdmluy. As the
elections had not been held an attempt was made to force
Plautius and Scipio to assume the consulship irregularly. The
bundles of rods (fasces), which were the symbols of authority,
were taken from the “grove of Libitina,'’ where they were kept,
and carried to the houses of Milo's two competitors. When
this had no effect, a joumey was made to Pompey's suburban
villa At this time Pompey was nominally governor of the
Spanish provinces, and according to the custom of the con-
stitution, would lose his command if he crossed the pomoerium
and entered the city. A clamour was raised by the throng
that he should make himself either consulor dictator, after the
pattern of Sulla². .

of the senate-house seemed to be even greater than the indigna-
tion aroused by the assassination of Clodius, trusted to see a
reaction in his favour. He therefore entered the capital on the =
day when the senate-house was burned, and proceeded with
his candidatum, which he supported by unstinted bribery. A
friendly tribune, M. Caelius Rufus, called meetings (contiones)
in his favour. The line taken was that Clodius had laid a trap
for Milo and had been caught in it himself. The successive
interreges found it impossible to carry the electioris through
in face of the opportunities which the constitution offered in
abundance to obstructors At last the senate passed a re·
solution addressed to the tribunes, to the interrex for the time ·
being, and to Pompey, who were charged “to look to it that
the interests of the nation took no harm³.'’ The form of
the decree was old, but the circumstances in which it was
adopted were without parallel. From the time of the Gracchi
