lollowing list of cxx. from the speech (not a complete listi: 4, l. 23 (where
re corresponds to verbis, voltu to sententiis); 19, l. ²13 τι, Ι. 45 aa, l. aa ;
3ο,11. 13, 143 35,11.6, 73 3o,11. oo, αις 39, ll 25, 263 40, l. 25³
42, p. 41, 11. 32, 33 3 45, 11. 5, 6; 64, ll. 30, 31. Chiasmus is ol course
often avoided as at 26, l. 313 30, 1. 133 35, 11. 4, 5: 43, 1. ra.
consutum: this may mean either “purpose” or “pmdence.” The

latter meaning is the more probable.

17 putarat esse: the infinitiva ends the clause because emphasis is
thrown on it.

P. 26.

1 temeritatem etc-2 here, as olten, Cic. insinuates that the mob which
was opposed to his client consisted of aliens or slaves. Conce'toto neul-
te'tudo is contrasted with reliqua multitudo in l. 6.

a auctonmte...amar0: t'or the metaphoras. Pro Sest. 24 eum eonsu- ’
latus...tamquaoe gladius esset datus.

arma: the soldiers had no doubt “piled arms.”

4 denuntiant: this verb is ordinarily used ol any formal notice served
on any one in connexion with a trial, whether civil or criminal. So
denuntiare teslz'monium alicui “to serve a subpoena.” The notice is
usually hostile, but not always3 hence we need not say there is zeugma
here because denuntiant is applied alike to the danger and to the pro·
lection from it.

noque...o1mue: “and to show not merely a resigned, but a coura·
genus spirit.”

6 pollicentur: while promittere is used of promises generallyg polliceri
applies to promises eagerly or readily made; cs. Pro Plane. ror nihil
tune de meis opibus pollicebar, scd de horum erga me benevolentia promet-
lebam.

7 quae qudem eet: the clause is merely descriptive: “I mean that
portion os it which consists ol citizens.” With sitit would be restric-
tive: “in so sar as it consists of citizens.” Roby§ 1692.

totu nostre eet: “is entirely on our side.’' For toto thus strongly
adverbial, cf. Quint. ιο, 1, 93 satira tota nostra est.

8 undique taruenna unde...auep101: undique heremanus “from
everywhere,” just as intus sometimes means “from within” (ἔντοσθεν),

as well as “within ”3 and nusquam is used to express “no whither¹’ ns
wellas “nowhere’'
