158 PRO MILONE ORATIO.

by Cic, not to theone he wrote, see the crit. n. in C. F. W. Mtlller’s
od· p. 38, l. 9 debeo: all Mss om. from debeo to solutam (l. ao),
except P, which has from fuer-it (in interfuerit) to salutarim the words
irom miletis to inter have been added by edd. from conj. (some give
audatis 101 videtis). Noting the number 01 lines on a page 01 P and
comparing P with other MSS, we find that five or six lines are still

mrssmg. Some indicatione 01 their oontents are given in passages 01
late rhetoricians (see Mltller's text). 5 35, l. ¹5 iustum: iniustum
may be the true reading. 537, p. 40, l.3 intentata: intenta H, ,
Asc. 539, p. 41, l. 3 lecit: secr'sset HTS. 1. 5 omnium: onrnr'a
tum codd.; corr. by Heumann. 5 4²· p. 4a, l. r veremur: 1 have
inserted this word, the letters 01 which are sufficiently like those 01
rumorem to account 101 its loss. SB om. levem H om. both fabulam
and falsam. Elias salsam fictam levem, T fictam falsam levem. Mr
Clark thinks fictam a gloss taken from fictis fabulis in 58, p· 08, l. 10.
But the phrase ficta fabula or fictae fabularis common, and H is
peculiarly capricious in its omissions. The chances are that the arche·
type 01 H and E agreed with Ε, and that fabulam fell out in H or some
immediate redecessor 01 H owing to the resemblance 01 the word to
salsam. The arrangement 01 three parallel clauses, each with its own
verb, all the three verbs being 01 cognate meaning (here timemus, per·
horrescimus, veremur) was a savourite one with Cic.; 01. 54. p. 46, 1.0

and therefore treated asa gloss by Mr Clark and Nohl. But (r)
the phrasing 01 the clause has nothing suspicions about it; (a) Cic.
would hardly, in speaking 01 this witness, resrain from agibe at his
former perjury; (3) the omission in the texts 01 Ascon, may well be due
to the copyists 01 that writer; indeed just above Schola and et idem are
omitted, and there is a similar important omission in 5 95. Τ110 gap in
H can only count as a coincidence, seeing how carelessly that ms osten
drops words. 547, l. 3² qui: Mss give ii or la· before this. Nohl
conjectures that convicti has fallen out after testibus, and Mr Clark
