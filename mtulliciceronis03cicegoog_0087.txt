82 PRO MILONE ORATIO. [ἓ 10-

28 nuuc paeto: lit. “on no bargain‚” ie. “on no terms”; hardly

different in sense from nullo νηπίω cs. 32, l. 3.

sat turtur etc: this sentence is notable for the number oi clauses, all
exactly parallel, which it contains Cic. himself quotes it in Orat. 165
as au example of caminadas, ie. parallelism (ἰσόκωλον, πάρισον).

29 non scripta etot cs. 3o,l.14 and De Leg. r, 19 quae (=lex‚ the
law oi nature) saeclis omnebus ante nata est quam scripta lex ullu. Greek
writers often contrast the written law with the unwr'itten law of nature
(ἄγραπτα νόμιμα or ἄγραφοι νόμοι τῆς φύσεως). The passage in the
Antigone oi Sophocles (450 sq.) iu which the contrast is euforced is well
known.

dtdtctmua accepturus hulmus: for words arranged in “threes'’ (a
favourite form with Cic.) cf. 56, l. 30· Daiiictmus includes in its meaning
the sense both of accepimus (audiamur, oral instruction) and of
legimur.

30 ex natum: this goes ill with expressimus, which means not “we
have wrung'' but ‘⁴ we have sramed, shaped‚ moulded‚’' the metaphor
being derived from the fictile arts. In fact there is a slight zeugma.

31 ad qnam...noott: rather unusual, but cf. erudr'read iu Pro Font. 43
and Pro Imp. Cn. Pomp. 283 auditori ad iu Verr. a, 3, 188, and
dorilei ad in Tusc. a, 15.

32 tmhutlr “iugrained.¹’ Imbuere first meant “to dyc'’ (cf. 18, l. 7),
or literally “to cause to drink‚'’ being a compound oi a lost verb batere,
to drink or cause to drink (cf. minibua “winebibber’' in Plautus). So
bibere, baurim, potare aud similar words are used oi dyeing. Theu
imbuere implies giving a man his first “tinctum” of some knowledge or
skill; see Wilkins on De Orat. 2, 162. A well-known fragment oi
Cicero’s lost work ‘⁸ Hortensius '' illustrates at once the first meaning and
the constr. with ad: ut ei qui combibi purpuram volunt, sufficiunt
(⁶‘steep ’' or “stain-'') prius lanam medicamentis quibura'am, sic litteris
talibusque doctm'mi ante excoli animaret ad sapientmm conctjbr‘endam

· imbui et praeparari decet (C. F. W. Mueller’s tert of the philosophioal,

works111. p. 3¹ 5). For the use of imbutus ofa slight tincture cf.

Tac. Dial. 19, where it is contrasted with imtructur, and Orbilius ap.

Sueton. Gram.4 non perfectum sed imbutum le'tterih; but it often implies

(as here and Phil. ro, ao) a thorough knowledge.
ut...asaet: this clause is explanatory oi baec lex, the words srom

quam nen driie'cimus to imbuti sumus being parenthetic.
in vim at ln tola: generally the preposition is not repeated astera
copulative conjunctim, unless the two words connected by the conjunc·
