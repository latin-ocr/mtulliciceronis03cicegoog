Every one of these arguments is os a type thoroughly recognised and
laboriously discussed, in the ancient works on rhetoric. The particular
treatment which each topic received at Cicero's hands met with admi·
ration among the ancientsw. The least satisfactory ol the six arguments
is the first. The contentiori that Milo’s real interests required that
Clodius should continue alive, is excessively artificial.

. The conclusion (ept'logw, parratio) always aimed principally at
pathos. But the bearing os Milo all through the trial had been such that
Cicero could not appeal to the ’ury for pity in his client’s name. Rather
he puts into Milo's mouth high-souled and stoical utterances, while he
begs mercy on his own account, as bein in a sense the cause os the
arear errans{cinerescunt

overhung the whole trial from first to last²¹. The: prevailing gloom ma
be the reason why we have throughout the whole oration hardly a flash
of Cicero’s brilliant talent sonamite and caricature.
