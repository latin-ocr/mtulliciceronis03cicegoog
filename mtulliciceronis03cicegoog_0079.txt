74 PRO MILONE ORATIO. [ἓ 5..

30 exercitum: “harassed ”3 cf. Suet. Tib. 6 infamiam pueritiamque
habuit laboriosam atque exercitam (of the emperor Tiberius). On the
other hand exercitatus in Cicero’s time meant “experienced,” though
later writers (as Tacitus) gave it the sense 01 exercitus.

31 diet aut ungi: “said or imagined”: so De Fin. 1, 41 quid aa
miserius dici aut fingi potest?

ad...aduuet1: ‘⁴ lured into our country’s service.”

33 oetam ete: “storms of all other kinds '³ are contrasted with the
perilous “stom” which is sometimes met with in a court (1. 3 in
t'uda'cio vcra), to which Cic. gives the name iniqui iudici procella in Pro
Sest. 140. The use ol catenas and alius where their sense is made clear
by what comes aiter (a “proleptic” use) does not accord with English
idiom, but is common in Latin. See n. ou De Amicitia 7, in the Pitt
Press ed.

1. aa

1 dumtaxat: always an adverb in Latin, 1101 1 conjunctiora. Cicero

employs the word sar ostener than any other extant Latin writer. He
has it in 3001 40 passages, whereas in Caesar it only occurs once, and
in Livy two or three times. Its ordinary use is to point out a concession
which the writer makes or expects to be made to him. In 111 the
Ciceronian examples the meaning may be given by “ certainly '² or “ at
all events,” and there is no passage where sana might not be substituted
without aflecting the sense. [For sane see n. on ἓ 30, l. 9.] Dumtaxat
seems to be ol legal origin; ior its derivation see n. on De Amicitia 53
(Pitt Press ed). Its earliest use is in statutos which authorise a magis-
trate to inflict a fine, dumtaxat introducing the amount oi the tine in the
genitive case, “provided he assesses it at so much.'' The word is rare
in verse 3 Horace has it twice, Lucretius a lew times.

contionum: Quintilian 8, 6, 48 notes that the'introduction os this
word brings Cicero's metaphors into touch with reality.

1 nous: constantly used by Cic. in a political sense (like ἀγαθοὶ in the
Greek Lyric poets) to indicate the party oi the optimates, which word in
itself involves a similar use oi optimus. Cf. boni...improbi in ἓ 31, l. 7.

3 1011111111 sentim means not only 10 hold an opinion, but also to
express it, as here; see my n. on Academ. 1, 13.
