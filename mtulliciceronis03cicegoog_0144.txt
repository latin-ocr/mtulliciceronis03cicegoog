5105] NOTES. '¹39

§lon

a vomu: put here ior the more usual dative, in order to emphasise
the fact that the jurors must be the agents in preserving Milo. In all
Latin, the exx. οἱ abl. with ab alter gerundive as compared with dative
are few. Some are due to the necessity os avoiding ambiguity‚ as eg.
where the gerundivo is from a verb which ordinarily takes the dative3 so
in Pro Imp. Cn. P. 6 quibus est a vobis...consulendum.

ro poenas...1mrn: lit. “let him· have paid the penalty,” ie. “I arn
content that he has pald the penalty.'¹

nos: for the change lrominquit cf. m on η, l. 28.

or hicine: thisand sicine were used, not ltz'cm, st'cne, nor hiccine, siccine.
’ 22 11 rorte: “possibly‚” like the parenthetic ei τύχοιε see Munro on
Lucret. 5, 720. The clause is abbreviated sor si sorte ita acciderit, or
something oi the kind. It is assumed that a citizen who dies for Rome
dies in the enemy’s country.

bolus: dependent on animi, not agreeing.

ἕ 10³.

28 lammis: in the perorations to several of Cicero’s speeches he de-
clares that his grief compels him to stop. Prae with the sense “because
of” only occurs with a negative in the best prose.

30 quod...cudeet1r: “to have the coumge of your opinions.”

31 1· probabit: cf. Veli. Pat. n, 47, 4 Milonem reum non ntnm's invidiis
fizcti quam Ponqter'i damnavit volunta& an account which is probably
neurer the truth.
