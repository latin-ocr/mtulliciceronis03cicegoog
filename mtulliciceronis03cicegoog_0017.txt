passed “de patriciis convocandis.’' What is here meant by
patricii is not exactly known; but these patrini nominated the
first interrex, who, like his successors, was bound to be chosen
from one of the ancient patrician families. The first interrex
could not summon the comitia, but at the end of five days

nominated another, who similarly nominated another, and so on,

Fausta (the daughter of the great Sulla) and a friend, M. Fufius.
