tion are very distinct in meaning. But no hard and fast rule can be laid
down, especially as the writers oi the uss. have confused the matter by
caprieiously inserting and omitting the smaller prepositions. cf. 5, ll.

oi esset below.

r nonum: this although it stands between enanis and ratio is predica-
tive not attributive.
andiendus: lit. “oi disentangling‚'' i.e. “oi securing.” Ct'. impc-
dire salutem in De Leg. Agr. a, 7.
silent leges inter arma: a maxim much quoted in modern times and
often misapplied. For the personification oi leges cf. De Leg. 3, 39 sa'

Quendam modo, like nescioquo modo and quasi or qm'dam (21, p. 33,

phorieal or otherwise unusual word or phrase.

an ordinary verbal noun (defensionis). Defendendi therefore has a
more general sense than ii sc or sui (as below) had been added.

Digest. 48, 8, ιε lege Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis tenetur qui hommem

crit. n. in App. C.
