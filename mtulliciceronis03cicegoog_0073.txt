conuuetudlnem fori: this phrase and pastinum morene iudr'ciorurre

corona: the metapbor in our “ring'‘ us applied to people is much
the same. The poet Lucan had this passage in mind when he wrote
(r‚319)r Quis casira timenti Ι nescit mixtasorol gladii cunr triste rrrinan·

outside them; but the sense more probably is (literally) “in the front
