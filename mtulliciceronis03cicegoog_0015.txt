evidence to prove that at the time when the offence was alleged
to have been committed, he was far away at Interamna, a town
close to the meeting-place of the rivers Nar and Tiber1. Cicero
swore that he had met Clodius in Rome at an hour which made
his pretended visit to Interamna impossible. From that moment
till his death Clodius pursued Cicero with unrelenting animosity,
and in 58 used his power as turbulent tribune to procure the
passing of a statute whereby the orator was driven into exile, ou

death without trial.

that date little is known. His original family was that of the
Papii‚ but his maternal grandfather Annius adopted him as a
son, and bestowed on him his name and the succession to his
property. Milo opened a campaign against Clodius by an
attempt to prosecute him for illegal violence². When law failed,
recourse was had to force. Milo enrolleda band of gladiators for
which the host of Clodius was no matchl. The most sanguinary
conflicts took place. After one fight, the dead were piled in

The law for restoring Cicero was passed on Aug. 4, but the tur-

aedileship, and Milo obstructed the business of the electiori,
which was not concluded till Jan 20 in the year 56⁶. An unsuc·
cessful effort was at once made by the new aedile to rid himself
of his rival by getting sentenoe against him for the use of vio·
lence⁰. The struggles between the two continued for three years
more, when Clodius was removed by the sword. During this time
Cicero suffered much from Clodius and was indeed sometimes
iu personal dangerl. He owed everything to the protection of
