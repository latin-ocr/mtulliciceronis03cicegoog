from Milo, he pretended to believe a story that Milo meant to
assassinate him, and he even imparted the information to the
public in a speech. Attaclrs on Milo continued to be made
both in the forum and in the senate. At a meeting of the
senate about Feb. 18 Metellus Scipio gave his version of the
conflict at Bovillae, pointing out, among other matters, that
while eleven men in the¹ company of Clodius had been killed,

slaves of his own who had been most active in the fray, that
they might not be compelled to give evidence against him.

should take place under the ordinary lav, but “extra ordinem
apud quaesitorem’'; that is to say, that a special president
should be appointed for these cases, so that they might be judged
speedily. A demand was made that the two parts of this
motion should be put to the vote separately. This was done,
and the first part, condemning the crimes, was accepted3 but
